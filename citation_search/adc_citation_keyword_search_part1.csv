Because boreal forests contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, any change to the fire regime will likely have substantial impacts on C exchange and storage. This project will utilize a chronosequence approach to examine how fire and permafrost interact to influence forest regeneration and C sequestration within larch forests near arctic treeline in Far Northeastern Siberia. The hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer depth mediates C storage through indirect impacts on forest regeneration because of its role as a thermal regulator and barrier to seed germination. This research will build on investigations initiated in summer 2010 and will be compared to recent and ongoing research within Interior Alaska. A cross-polar comparison will increase our understanding of how C dynamics under an altered fire regime vary across boreal regions with differing permafrost dynamics and vegetation types. This fellowship will support the post-doctoral fellow?s career goals by providing training in arctic boreal forest ecology, experience in executing independent research, skills in mentoring undergraduate students, and an opportunity to collaborate with arctic researchers from within and outside the U.S. By addressing fundamental questions concerning how an altered fire regime indirectly impacts C cycling of Siberian larch forests, this study will provide much needed information about an ecologically important yet understudied region and will improve our ability to predict the impacts of climate change and altered fire regimes on arctic ecosystems. Siberian larch forests comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are a critical component of the global C cycle. They are different from other boreal forests in that they are comprised of a single tree genus (Larix spp.), with a deciduous growth habit, that often grows on continuous permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Our current knowledge of their ecology and potential susceptibility to climate change remains limited because of logistical constraints associated with conducting research in Siberia and minimal translations of Russian scientific efforts into English. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. By comparing results to the relatively well-studied boreal forests of interior Alaska, the study will further our ability to detect whether boreal response to changing fire is similar across zones differing in permafrost characteristics and vegetation types, or whether more detailed studies are needed for accurate modeling of ecosystem response to climate change. The study will contribute to our understanding of how boreal fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up boreal forest C pools, estimating C emissions from boreal fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling. Broader Impacts: The research will advance our understanding of Siberian larch forests, an important yet understudied ecosystem, while advancing the teaching and mentoring skills of a post- doctoral researcher. The post-doctoral fellow?s research activities, methodologies, and findings will be integrated into the education of undergraduate students through participation in the NSF-funded Polaris Project lecture series and discussion groups and by mentoring of an undergraduate field assistant in ecosystem ecology. Basing field research out of the Northeast Science Station in the Russian Far Northeast will provide a venue for building partnerships between the post-doctoral fellow, other arctic researchers from the U.S., and Russian collaborators. The collaborations will be used to integrate research findings with Russian scientific efforts. Scientific findings resulting from the proposed research will be widely disseminated through publications in scientific journals, presentations at international conferences, and more informally, through postings on the post-doctoral researcher?s web page. Active layer and soil moisture measurements will be submitted to the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring network to provide critical data for model validations and scaling-up of climate change impacts on boreal forest ecosystems."," Scientific findings resulting from the proposed research will be widely disseminated through publications in scientific journals, presentations at international conferences, and more informally, through postings on the post-doctoral researcher",,

The chief goal is working to develop better instruments and ways of measuring snow in the Arctic, and analyzing the resultant data. At sites at Barrow, Imnavait Creek, Fox, and Nome Creek Alaska, and in Inuvik, Canada the team has installed meteorological and snow measuring instrumentation including solid-state snow pillows, heated plate precipitation sensors, snow fences (to capture the wind-blown flux), and normal and eddy correlation meteorological towers for monitoring snowfall and snow on the ground. In addition to these autonomous instruments, the team periodically runs intense field campaigns during which a variety snow surveys are conducted, including surveys of snow cover depth, snow water equivalent, density, stratigraphy and other properties. These ground-based surveys are being augmented using aerial photography and ground- and airborne LiDAR. Part of the project is also focused on developing new types of sensors and techniques, including the development of small, low-cost sonic sounders for depth, rotating sonic sounders for better averages of depth, and airborne and ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for extensive snow depth and surface topography. The combined suite of instrument development and measurement protocols is designed to allow closure of the winter water balance and lead to better ways of monitoring Arctic snow for climate. Within the U.S., this improvement in monitoring would directly benefit the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), one of the prime agencies charged with monitoring precipitation and snow cover, as well as the U.S. Weather Service.

Model development is described by Padman and Erofeeva (2004) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL019003). The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry (Jakobsson et al., 2000; https://doi.org/10.1029/00EO00059). AODTM5 consists of grids of sea surface height (SSH) and depth-integrated currents (“volume transports”) for each of 8 tidal constituents; 4 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2) and 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1). The model solves the depth-integrated shallow water equations, with forcing at open ocean boundaries from the TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic tidal solution version 6.2 (TPXO.6.2) and local astronomical forcing (“potential tides”). Each constituent in AODTM5 was tuned, separately, to Arctic tide height data by optimizing the linear drag coefficient.  As a dynamics-based model, AODTM5 is self-consistent: within the constraints of the simplified physics, heights and currents are determined by the bathymetric grid and the imposed forcing. Two other tide models are available at the Arctic Data Center; the Arctic Ocean Inverse Tide Model on a 5 km grid (AOTIM5) (also described by Padman and Erofeeva, 2004) and an updated version created in 2018 (Arc5km2018). These two models are “inverse” models, assimilating tide gauge, bottom pressure recorder and satellite altimetry estimates of SSH. We expect these data assimilation models to provide more accurate predictions of SSH. However, they do not necessarily provide better predictions of depth-averaged currents. We recommend that users compare results from all three models (AODTM5, AOTIM5 and Arc5km2018) before deciding which to use for a specific application.

This study integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while at the same time promoting teaching, training, and learning in at least four substantial ways: 1) by conducting our field research with the active participation of four village communities and village-level research assistants; 2) by collaborating with an in-country research team; 3) by working with a research assistant and two graduate students for the project's duration; and 4) by collaborating with an international research partner. By working at the local, regional and Republic levels and through collaborating with the in-country research institute and other partners on climate issues, the project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education networks and partnerships. The project team will disseminate the results of the project widely to enhance scientific and technological understanding via academic and non-academic publications, a project website, and by generating a set of resource materials available to others interested in community based climate change projects. The proposed activity is designed to benefit society on several levels, by increasing the understanding of the local effects of GCC for the targeted communities, by producing resource materials to share that knowledge with other populations, to inform policy decisions, and to enhance research collaborations and exchanges."," The project team will disseminate the results of the project widely to enhance scientific and technological understanding via academic and non-academic publications, a project website, and by generating a set of resource materials available to others interested in community based climate change projects",,

The ""Intellectual Merit"" of BSSN lies in its operation as a distributed network which employs people as individual, coordinated sensors for local environmental observations of socio-ecological change. BSSN will address the following questions: (1) how have economically significant species changed over the past century and what strategies have residents used to cope with these changes; (2) what key biophysical variables and indicators may be correlated to changes in distribution and properties of ecologically significant species; (3) how well do indigenous and traditional knowledge and Western science show spatial/temporal convergence and statistical correlation at local and regional scales; and (4) what are the major trends, patterns and constraints in individual and community adaptation to changes? The ""Broader Impacts"" of this award include a better understanding of Arctic environmental system change and resilience, and how to develop appropriate adaptation strategies to change for Arctic communities. BSSN will leave a legacy for a broad community of arctic residents striving to organize an observing system that is a valid partner in pan-Arctic environmental system observations. A key product will be a widely disseminated and highly accessible publication entitled The State of the Bering Sea Bioresources: Perspectives of Local Residents, an assessment based on observations of local and indigenous observers. Other products will include a tool kit for communities to develop their own observing programs based on the framework of BSSN, and an annual illustrated magazine aimed at the village and regional levels.

Petermann Glacier drains a significant fraction of the northern Greenland ice sheet and terminates in a large floating ice shelf that is sensitive to ice-ocean interactions. Ice retreat over the last decade opens access to the fjord and presents an opportunity to understand sedimentation processes under the area previously covered by ice shelf and to calibrate reconstructions of past ice shelf variations. Using a variety of technologies and approaches on land, ice, and at sea, the investigators will map the bottom of the fjord in front of and under the ice shelf; reconstruct ocean conditions and their role in ice shelf variations through time; reconstruct the past extent of the glacier on land and the floating ice shelf; and reconstruct local relative sea level. Together these efforts will create a comprehensive picture of the climate conditions and response of the Petermann Glacier to these conditions over the last 10,000 years.  Of key interest will be the timing, extent, rates of change, and variability (on land and in the sea) during the early Holocene when local relative sea level was over 100 meters higher than today (due to lagging isostatic rebound of the crust in response to deglaciation), but the inland ice sheet was still large relative to today. The investigators will address dynamic responses to multiple interacting variables over a range of response times (from tens to thousands of years) relevant to potential future impacts. Specific research questions include: 1) How sensitive is Petermann ice shelf extent to documented climate changes within the Holocene? 2) Is shelf response independent of, or linked to, variations in the grounded Petermann Glacier, ocean thermal conditions, or relative sea level (i.e., sill depth)? 3) What are the rates of change and variability of these systems in response to early Holocene warming, Neoglacial cooling, and recent warming? The project will support several young investigators and will provide them with both ship and land-based training experiences.

The GrIT route offers a unique opportunity to study a wide range of snow accumulation zones (i.e. the ablation zone, soaked snow zone, the percolation zone and the dry snow zone) across Greenland, which are expected to have a broad range of albedo values as well as significant variability in snow physical properties and concentrations of light absorbing compounds (i.e. dust, elemental carbon, and brown carbon). The project's field component will take place over two seasons during the spring of 2013 and 2014. The approach will include stopping along the traverse to collect coincident daily measurements of snow spectral albedo, snow physical properties (i.e. specific surface area, density), surface snow light absorption properties (i.e. wavelength dependent absorption of water soluble compounds and particulates), and the concentrations of trace elements, organic, and elemental carbon. Additionally, the temporal evolution of spectral albedo will be monitored continuously during the sunlit months using autonomous stations deployed along the traverse route to track seasonal variations of snow albedo and to help attribute these variations to the physical and chemical composition of the snow. The results of this project will yield a unique data set characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of surface albedo as well as the physical and chemical properties of Greenland snow, which are broadly useful to both modeling, ice mass balance, and remote sensing communities. Conference presentations, rapid publication of results, and most importantly close collaboration with modelers, (i.e. through work with the CESM PCWG) will ensure that this knowledge is used to improve process parameterizations in predictive global climate models.

The Polaris Project will achieve a broad and lasting impact by linking interdisciplinary scientific research to innovative undergraduate education and imaginative public outreach. In addition to providing a transformative experience for the participants in the annual Siberian field course, Polaris II will educate large numbers of undergraduate students who complete the Polaris-affiliated on-campus courses. The project will also engage K-12 students and teachers through direct and sustained interactions with Polaris PIs and broad dissemination of education and outreach materials. Finally, Polaris II will inform a diverse public audience about the state of the Arctic, ecosystems research, and global climate change. Approaches to project outreach include expansion of the Polaris website and associated blog (www.thepolarisproject.org) and the development of an online seminar series for undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and public participants. The production and wide distribution of multimedia videos addressing key arctic science themes will further expand the reach of the project, as will the inclusion of a writer in the 2011 field course with the objective of publishing a book about the Arctic, climate change, and the Polaris Project experience. As a resource for the scientific and education communities, Polaris data will be freely available through the project website and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS)."," The production and wide distribution of multimedia videos addressing key arctic science themes will further expand the reach of the project, as will the inclusion of a writer in the 2011 field course with the objective of publishing a book about the Arctic, climate change, and the Polaris Project experience",,

The dataset includes stage-specific abundance data for C. hyperboreus copepodid stages (C1-C5) and adults (C6 male or female)  given as ind. m-3 or ind. m-2. Data of merged stages (e.g. C1-C3) or of other units (biomass, presence/absence etc.) were not included.  Data missing information about sampling date, location (longitude, latitude), depth (upper and lower depth of sample), gear or mesh size were not included. If only lower sampling depth was given for subsequent stations, we assumed upper sampling depth was at the surface.  Obvious errors (e.g. unrealistic sampling positions) were corrected if there was a clear data entry error, otherwise, the entry was removed.  Some data are depth-integrated (surface-bottom), while other are for specific depth layers with multiple layers per station.  The data span from 1934 to 2016 and cover the entire Arctic Ocean and surrounding subarctic seas.

In addition, tables of some aspects of data analysis are also included such as the results of Principal Component Analysis of the mineral weight% data, and the clustering of the grain-size curves (Minasny and McBratney, 2002). Data are also included on the results of a sediment unmixing exercise using the .xls macro program SedUnMixMC. 1) Core location and water depth 2) New radiocarbon dates for cores PS2631, PS2640, and JM07-174GC. 3) Data for color reflectance (CIE*) are listed for cores PS2623, PS2631 and PS2640. 4) Grain-size data from the Malvern laser system are given for cores PS2623, PS2631, PS2640, and PS2641. 5) Mineral weight% data based on quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis (Eberl, 2003) of the < 2 mm sediment are listed for cores PS2623, PS2627, PS2729, PS2630, PS2631, PS2640, and PC2641, and JM07-174GC. 6) Principal component scores for all cores on XRD logratio mineralogy 7) Results of fuzzy clustering of the grain-size % data and the logratio data 8) Results of running SedUnMixMC on the source sediments---the red numbers indicate the fraction associated with that sediment source---ideally should be close to 1.0. 9) Results of the 4 source sediment unmixing analysis using SedUnMixMC (Andrews et al., 2015; Andrews and Eberl, 2012) Methods The color reflectance of dried sediment was measured with an X-Rite spectrophotometer, Model 500 Series, using the CIE* system, with L* a measure of black to white, a* (blue to red) and b* (yellow to green. The prepared dry samples were tapped into a 2.5 cm dia. aluminum XRD holder, overlain by a clear glass slide, and measured. A Pantone Color Chip (4705) was measured repeatedly to evaluate instrument drift. Grain-size analyses were undertaken on sediments from PS2623, PS2631, PS2640, and PS2641 using a Malvern model 2000 laser system for the range 2000 to 0.5 µm. Add 5mL of hydrogen peroxide again and repeat the process. Keep repeating the process until the organic is gone (there is no reaction occurring). When organic is removed and the beakers are cooled a little add 8-10mL of magnesium chloride to each beaker. We employ the quantitative X-ray diffraction method developed by Eberl (2003, 2004). The sediment < 2 mm are spiked by 10% by weight of zincite, milled, and the samples are scanned on a D5000 Siemens X-Ray Diffractometer between 5° and 65° 2-theta with a 0.02° step and a 2-sec count. The resulting 3000 data points are loaded into the Excel macro-program Rockjock v6 (Eberl, 2003) and the weight% of minerals in the sediment mixtures calculated against a suite of 124 ""standard"" mineral patterns (Eberl, 2003). Finally, the data are normalized to sum to 100%. In this paper we present the results on 8 cores. For PS2641 this included data on both the < 63µm fraction and the < 2mm fraction (0-300 cm).",In this paper we present the results on 8 cores,,

The 2010 datasets extend from March 18, 2010 until June 11, 2010; 2011 datasets extend from May 6-24. In the first two weeks of each dataset, pump tests were conducted to investigate the response of the glacier to local water pressure perturbations. In 2010, data come from two different dataloggers, a Campbell CR10X and a Campbell CR1000. In 2011, datasets come from each of these two loggers as well as an Acoustic Emissions system. The included matlab scripts contain commands to load and parse data from the data files and to apply calibrations. The CR10X files output readings from the friction panel, described in the paper referenced above (and its associated online supplementary material). The panel measurements consist of two normal load cells, two shear load cells and two water-pressure transducers installed flush with the bed of the glacier. When calibrations from the matlab scripts are applied, the output yields kilopascals (kPa). NS1, NS2 = normal stress SS1, SS2 = shear stress WP1, WP2 = water pressure CR1000 files contain data from extensometers whose wires were fed through boreholes from he subglacial tunnel to the bed of the glacier, where anchors were embedded in basal ice or left on the glacier bed. Sampling interval in 2010 was 10 Hz, yielding very large files. The May 2010 data segment records some motion, but two extensometers had failed to work by this time. Output is in mm displacement. pot1, pot2, pot3: displacements in mm hammer: a boolean data string indicating whether a hammer-switch circuit was completed -- used to synchronize clocks with subglacial seismometers. The 2011 dataset includes a large number of files like enga066.dat and PRERUN066.txt. These are raw acoustic emissions files from a system also described in the paper referenced above. The system only recorded basic metrics from each AE hit that exceeded a nominal threshold, so there are no waveforms available. Each engaXXX.dat file contains a listing of these metrics from each hit, but contains only a timestamp that resets each time the system started a new file. Thus, the PRERUNXXX.txt file associated with each dat file contains the real time-string, from which timestamps are generated in the matlab script. Output from the script are two vectors: jtimeAE: a list of timestamps corresponding to times when an AE hit exceeded the threshold (40 dB) Amp: hit amplitude, in dB > 40.","c("" For additional information, please see the related publication: Moore, P"", "" The CR10X files output readings from the friction panel, described in the paper referenced above (and its associated online supplementary material)"", "" These are raw acoustic emissions files from a system also described in the paper referenced above"")",,

Melting of the Greenland ice sheet and loss of Arctic Ocean sea ice are two processes that have increased dramatically since the late 20th century. Here, we provide a four-part educational module focused on these two processes designed for upper middle school, high school and undergraduate students. Through this investigative module students learn critical science skills as they collect, analyze and draw conclusions from data and engage with some of the most urgent environmental questions of our time. Finally, they are challenged to think about how these changes are affecting their lives and the lives of others around the globe.  The teaching module is described in Holzer and Rennermalm (2019) and includes video and data resources, and step-by-step instructions.  This teaching module consists of four activities:  Activity 1: My burning Feet (Engage)  Activity 2: From burning feet to the Greenland Ice Sheet: Examining model estimates of Greenland ice sheet mass loss, its drivers, and its impact on global sea levels (Explore and Explain)  Activity 3: Should I Move Inland? What About Others Around the World - Should They Move to Higher Ground? (Elaborate)  Activity 4: How Does Melting Arctic Ice (sea ice &amp;amp;amp; ice sheets) Impact the Climate Where I live? (Evaluate)  The following materials are included in the module:  •        Teacher instructions of the entire module (Greenland Hydrology Teacher Notes.pdf)  •        Detailed teacher instructions for Activity 2 (Greenland hydrology activity 2 teacher instructions.pdf)  •        Lecture power point material (TeacherPPTs.pptx)  •        Student worksheets for each module (Greenland hydrology activity [1,2,3,4] wrksht.pdf)  •        Student report document for Activity 2 (Greenland Hydrology Student Report Document.pdf)  •        Data files for Activity 2  •        Video resources (Welcome_To_Greenland.mov, Why_the_Arctic_matters.mov)  •        Videos featuring four scientists uncovering the secrets of Greenland ice sheet in four short videos (Scientist_in_Greenland_Asa.mov, Scientist_in_Greenland_Rohi.mov, Scientist_in_Greenland_Sasha.mov, Scientist_in_Greenland_Vena.mov)  •        An article about the module published in The Earth Scientist by Holzer and Rennermalm (2019)  Part of Activity 2, students will analyze model estimates simulated with a regional climate model that also calculates ice sheet mass balance.

Measuring greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, particularly outside of the summer period, is very challenging due to extreme weather conditions. This research project provided the first annual balance of both CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes in a total of five sites spanning a 300Km transect across the North Slope of Alaska (three sites in Barrow, one site in Aquasuk, and one site in Ivotuk). The results from the continuous year-round CH 4 fluxes across these sites showed how cumulative emissions for the cold season accounted on average for 50% of the annual budget (Zona et al., 2016), a notably higher contribution than previously modelled, and also higher than observed in boreal Alaska. The analysis of the cold period CH 4 fluxes suggested that the presence of an unfrozen soil layer in the fall and early winter was a major control on cold season CH 4 emissions (Zona et al., 2016). We also cross-compared all instruments measuring ecosystem scale CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes operating at our sites, which allowed us to make recommendation of the best performing instruments under these extreme weather conditions. The best performing instruments were closed path analyzers and intermittently heated sonic anemometers which had the highest final data cover. A continuously heated anemometer increased data coverage relative to non-heated anemometers, but resulted in an overestimation of the fluxes (Goodrich et al., 2016). We developed an intermittent heating strategy that was only activated when the data quality was low, and appeared to be the preferable method to prevent icing while avoiding biases to the measurements. Closed and open-path analyzers showed good agreement, but data coverage was much greater when using closed-path analyzers, especially during winter (Goodrich et al., 2016). Given the importance of vegetation on greenhouse gas emissions, we also investigated the role of different vegetation types under a broad range of environmental conditions on the CH 4 emissions. We found that vegetation type can be a very useful tool to describe the spatial variability in CH 4 emissions over the landscape (McEwing et al., 2015), and that just two vegetation types were able to explain about 50% of the variability in CH 4 fluxes across ecosystems even hundreds of kilometers apart (Davidson et al., 2016a). To upscale these plot scale fluxes we completed high resolution vegetation maps in each of our tower sites (Davidson et al., 2016b), which are the finest resolution maps currently available from these sites, and also contributed to larger scale mapping effort (Walker et al., 2016). The soil microbial analysis from soil cores collected across our sites showed an association between overall microbial diversity and latitude, with a higher diversity found in the northerly site and lower diversity in the southerly site, contrary to current knowledge (Wagner et al., accepted). We also measured CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations in the soil, which showed to be orders of magnitude higher than in the atmosphere (Arndt et al., 2016). Our results contributed to model development (Xu et al., 2016; Kobayashi et al., 2016; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Luus et al., 2017), and to a wide variety of other projects as shown by the hundreds of download of our data from Ameriflux.

Measuring greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, particularly outside of the summer period, is very challenging due to extreme weather conditions. This research project provided the first annual balance of both CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes in a total of five sites spanning a 300Km transect across the North Slope of Alaska (three sites in Barrow, one site in Aquasuk, and one site in Ivotuk). The results from the continuous year-round CH 4 fluxes across these sites showed how cumulative emissions for the cold season accounted on average for 50% of the annual budget (Zona et al., 2016), a notably higher contribution than previously modelled, and also higher than observed in boreal Alaska. The analysis of the cold period CH 4 fluxes suggested that the presence of an unfrozen soil layer in the fall and early winter was a major control on cold season CH 4 emissions (Zona et al., 2016). We also cross-compared all instruments measuring ecosystem scale CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes operating at our sites, which allowed us to make recommendation of the best performing instruments under these extreme weather conditions. The best performing instruments were closed path analyzers and intermittently heated sonic anemometers which had the highest final data cover. A continuously heated anemometer increased data coverage relative to non-heated anemometers, but resulted in an overestimation of the fluxes (Goodrich et al., 2016). We developed an intermittent heating strategy that was only activated when the data quality was low, and appeared to be the preferable method to prevent icing while avoiding biases to the measurements. Closed and open-path analyzers showed good agreement, but data coverage was much greater when using closed-path analyzers, especially during winter (Goodrich et al., 2016). Given the importance of vegetation on greenhouse gas emissions, we also investigated the role of different vegetation types under a broad range of environmental conditions on the CH 4 emissions. We found that vegetation type can be a very useful tool to describe the spatial variability in CH 4 emissions over the landscape (McEwing et al., 2015), and that just two vegetation types were able to explain about 50% of the variability in CH 4 fluxes across ecosystems even hundreds of kilometers apart (Davidson et al., 2016a). To upscale these plot scale fluxes we completed high resolution vegetation maps in each of our tower sites (Davidson et al., 2016b), which are the finest resolution maps currently available from these sites, and also contributed to larger scale mapping effort (Walker et al., 2016).

Ethane is also thought to have a source through natural geologic outgassing (Etiope and Ciccioli, 2009). Ethane and acetylene levels in the atmosphere can be used to quantify the variability in fossil fuel and biomass burning through time. In this project, paleo-atmospheric levels of ethane and acetylene were co-measured in the air bubbles of polar ice cores using a wet-extraction (melt) method (see Nicewonger et al., 2016 GRL (Geophysical Research Letters), Nicewonger et al., 2018 PNAS, or Nicewonger, 2019 PhD thesis). Ice core samples from Summit, Greenland (GISP2B, GISP2D), and West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Antarctica (WDC05A, WDC06A) and South Pole, Antarctica (SPC14) were analyzed covering the last 2,000 years (~0 –1900 Common Era).  The paleo-atmospheric ethane levels from this project allowed for the reconstruction of biomass burning ethane emissions over the last 1,000 years (see Nicewonger et al., 2018 PNAS publication).  Please refer to the corresponding manuscript for more information on the “_Ethane.txt” data and how the gas ages were calculated (Nicewonger et al., 2018 PNAS SI Appendix).

Previous studies first conducted by our group and later by others show that water emerging from beneath the Russell Glacier in West Greenland has a higher partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) compared to atmospheric equilibrium. This CO 2 may originate from subglacial microbial metabolism, as well as carbonate weathering under closed system conditions. During downstream transport, the chemical weathering of glacial till may sequester excess CO 2 as HCO 3 , allowing the remainder to evade to the atmosphere. With this initial insight, key questions concern if, how, and to what extent CO 2 evasion will either increase or decrease as the ice sheet decays in a warmer world. Research activities tested five hypotheses designed to elucidate how microbial activity, hydrologic processes, and chemical weathering regulate the rate and extent of CO 2 evasion in the modern-day.  The project culminated in two peer-reviewed publications noted below. In one study, we investigated seasonal and interannual dissolved C cycling at the margin of the Russell Glacier. By synthesizing isotopic analyses of water (δ 18 O) and C (δ13C and Δ 14 C) with geomicrobiological observations, we found evidence for previously unknown connections between the GrIS’s supraglacial and subglacial dissolved C cycles. Supraglacial streams have variable concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and are the dominant source of DOC in subglacial discharge. Supraglacial stream dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations are uniform and sourced from a spatially and temporally constant mixture of organic C (~25%) respired by aerobic heterotrophs inhabiting the GrIS surface and dissolved atmospheric C (~75%). Supraglacial inputs account for ~50% of subglacial discharge DIC. The remaining subglacial DIC derives from carbonate weathering and microbial CO 2 production, with the latter attributable to abundant anaerobic heterotrophic communities observed in subglacial discharge. Furthermore, we found that supraglacial streams deliver young DOC to the subglacial environment during snowmelt and rain events. These pulses of organic C may drive heterotrophic microbial respiration, with the cumulative effect being a seasonal shift in the source of basal DIC, from microbial- to carbonate-dominated.  In a second study, we used major ion measurements, as well as radiogenic and stable Strontium (Sr) isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 88 / 86 Sr), to examine controls on solute acquisition in subglacial discharge from the Russell Glacier. One goal was to understand the fate of CO 2 produced by subglacial carbonate weathering and microbial metabolism. The study focused on two melt seasons in 2014 and 2015. Subglacial discharge 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are 13,000 ppm higher than those measured for bedload and suspended sediment digests, and are more similar to those of bedload sediment leachates. These results point to the preferential dissolution of minerals with high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Analyses of mineral separates from bulk rocks demonstrate that biotite, chlorite, hornblende, and K-feldspar have relatively high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Subglacial discharge δ 88 / 86 Sr values are about 0.10‰ higher than those for bedload and suspended sediment digests. Isotope fractionation during secondary mineral formation and/or adsorption cannot account for the difference between subglacial discharge and bedrock δ 88 / 86 Sr values, as suspended and bedload sediment leachates and digests produced similar δ 88 / 86 Sr values and are within the range for bulk silicate Earth. Consistent with the interpretation of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, we attribute the difference to the preferential dissolution of minerals with high δ 88 / 86 Sr values. Mineral separates display a wide range of δ 88 / 86 Sr values (0.40‰). Those having high δ 88 / 86 Sr values include hornblende and K-feldspar, as well as apatite and titanite. Taken together, the preferential weathering of predominately silicate minerals controls the transformation of CO 2 to HCO 3 in this setting. This study went on to examine the compositional evolution of water during subsequent downstream transport. Subglacial discharge from the Russell Glacier feeds the proglacial Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua River (AKR). Along a 32 km transect of the AKR from the GrIS margin toward the coast, riverine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios increase from 0.722 to 0.747 in an approximately stepwise pattern that corresponds to point-source inputs of additional subglacial discharge. Major cation concentrations and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios minimally vary along lengths of the transect with no hydrological inputs. This suggests that proglacial chemical weathering is negligible and likely does not contribute significantly to GrIS solute fluxes. In general, this later study supports the contention that silicate mineral weathering dominates the solute geochemistry of GrIS subglacial discharge in contrast to valley glaciers, which typically show substantial contributions from carbonate and sulfide weathering regardless of primary bedrock composition.

The award revolves around better understanding and prediction of the changing Arctic Ocean.  Most oceans are `stratified’ by temperature, meaning water density is controlled primarily by temperature. Most oceans have warm water near the surface and cold water at depth, because the cold water is denser and sinks.  The Arctic is unusual in that density is set primarily by salinity.  The near-surface water is often cold but fresh; the low salt content makes it quite light, despite its low temperature.  Below that there are several layers of water that are saltier (and hence denser), but can be significantly warmer than the surface.  This unusual layer structure allows the possibility of considerable heat being trapped at depth sub-surface. There  are several of these warm layers. In the Beaufort Sea, where this work was performed, there is often a layer of warm water between roughly 30 and 80 meters below the surface that is of Pacific origin; it has entered the Arctic through Bering Strait. Well below that (roughly 250-400 meters down) there is another warm layer coming from the Atlantic.  Historically, these sub-surface heat pockets were modest in temperature.  They were also fairly stable as they were usually isolated from storms by a cover of sea ice, lurking for years beneath the surface and circulating around basins, only very gradually releasing their heat.  In the New Arctic, several things are changing. First, the warmth of the sub-surface layers is increasing. Our focus is primarily on the Pacific origin water, the warmest variety of which is called Pacific Summer Water (PSW).  Several decades ago most of this water was of order 1 C.  More recent observations (including ours funded by this grant) have seen a new type of PSW arriving which is much, much warmer, up to 6 C.  Second, the rate at which this heat is turbulently mixed upwards may be changing, as the Arctic in general becomes more energetic with increasingly ice-free conditions.  A better understanding of both the processes that set this sub-surface heat structure and those which may turbulently mix the heat upwards, is crucial for improved forecast abilities for both the sea ice melt rate and a variety of other physical and ecosystem consequences.  The data in this file are measurements of the turbulent dissipation rate from a shear-probe equipped microstructure profiler. They were acquired with the 'Modular Microstructure Profiler' developed by Mike Gregg at the University of Washington and published using standard techniques.

Currently, one main subglacial meltwater conduit marked by a terminus embayment forcefully releases fresh water into the fjord. Basal meltwater and debris, evident from very high suspended sediment concentrations of up to 0.22 g L-1 (mean conc. at &#8805; 10m depth = 0.1 g L-1) rapidly exit the glacier, forming a density-controlled turbid upwelling from the grounding line at about 60 m depth. Sediment, as coarse as fine sand, is actively transported to the fjord surface and then quickly falls out of suspension. Silt and clay, however, spread laterally above the pycnocline at 10-12 m depth and are transported down-fjord. At about 240 m from the ice cliff and near the meltwater upwelling, the minimum measured sediment mass accumulation rate is 39.62 ± 0.01 g cm-2 a-1 (0.66 g cm-2 d-1; 5.0 mm d-1 vertical dry accumulation rate), and the rate decreases with distance from the ice cliff. Gravity cores taken at distances 630 m and 970 m from the calving margin indicate turbidity current activity beyond the modern morainal bank and adjacent subaqueous grounding-line fan. The base of each turbidite is marked by an increase in mean grain size coincident with an increased magnetic susceptibility. Mapping of the ice margin in 2005 indicates a slowing ice margin retreat rate (21 m a-1 between 1990 and 2005) in comparison with recent decades. This slowing trend may indicate increased overall ice flow rate or the possibility of the glacier beginning to pull out of the fjord. Our field work was conducted in July 2005 as part of the Svalbard REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program funded by the US National Science Foundation. The research is aimed at using glacimarine sedimentation as a proxy for modern climate change. Additionally, because of polar amplification in the climate system, studies of regional change expressed in glacial processes throughout the Arctic region are of interest for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of contemporary change. Field methods included use of suspended sediment traps, CTD/OBS instrumentation, water sampling, gravity and box coring, sub-bottom profiling, and iceberg sampling. Our sediment traps measured the highest sedimentation rates recorded in the fjord, but comparison between our measurements and previous studies is problematic for various reasons. However, measured sedimentation rates confirm these glaciers lie on a climatological spectrum between fully cold-based glaciers of Antarctica and warm-based glaciers of Alaska today.

A single transect was created as a ground truth line from which NASA IceBridge and NRL airborne missions could calibrate their instruments. The US Naval Academy team lead by LCDR John Woods was chief scientist for NAICEX. Two faculty and three students from the University of Delaware (UD) worked on the ice under the coordination of John Woods to collect ice survey data to support education and field exercises for Navy Cadets. CDR Angela Walker under Admiral White was present for three days to evaluate these exercises and promote future educational exercises. The UD portion was pulled together under an extremely tight budget with only two months to prepare, but that team performed very well and was able to bring together a small but very effective survey exercise involving the following simple instruments: Surveying of sea ice topography with polar grade TopCon Survey Gun GIS mapping of large scale events with ArcGIS software Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) profiling of sea ice thickness Drill hole validations These four data sets are included here with forthcoming papers on new EMI calibrations coming shortly through the Ph.D. doctoral work of Jesse P.

Along Alaska’s Beaufort Sea coast, erosion rates have increased roughly threefold from 6.8 to 19 m per yr since 1955 while the sea ice-free season has increased roughly twofold from 45 to 100 days since
1979. We develop a numerical model of bluff retreat to assess the relative roles of the length of sea ice-free
season, sea level, water temperature, nearshore wavefield, and permafrost temperature in controlling
erosion rates in this setting. The model captures the processes of erosion observed in short-term
monitoring experiments along the Beaufort Sea coast, including evolution of melt notches, topple of ice
wedge-bounded blocks, and degradation of these blocks. Model results agree with time-lapse imagery
of bluff evolution and time series of ocean-based instrumentation. Erosion is highly episodic with 40% of
erosion is accomplished during less than 5% of the sea ice-free season. Among the formulations of the
submarine erosion rate we assessed, we advocate those that employ both water temperature and nearshore
wavefield. As high water levels are a prerequisite for erosion, any future changes that increase the frequency
with which water levels exceed the base of the bluffs will increase rates of coastal erosion. The certain
increases in sea level and potential changes in storminess will both contribute to this effect. As water
temperature also influences erosion rates, any further expansion of the sea ice-free season into the
midsummer period of greatest insolation is likely to result in an additional increase in coastal retreat rates.

The three overarching objectives of Polaris II are to 1) train the next generation of arctic researchers, 2) advance scientific understanding of the Arctic, and 3) expand public awareness of the feedbacks between the Arctic and the global climate system. These objectives will be accomplished through a multi-faceted effort that includes a summer field course/research experience in the Siberian Arctic, a series of on-campus arctic-focused courses, and a wide range of outreach activities. While undergraduate students remain the primary focus of Polaris II, participation in the annual field course will be expanded to include a K-12 teacher, graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, and visiting faculty member each year. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate students and faculty, and a diverse public audience. The unifying scientific theme of the Polaris Project is the transport and transformation of carbon and nutrients as they move with water from terrestrial uplands to the Arctic Ocean. Research conducted by the interdisciplinary Polaris Project team of faculty and students will make fundamental contributions to the scientific understanding of this topic, a central issue in arctic system science. While continued scientific advances are essential for arctic system understanding, prediction, and protection, tackling the climate change challenge is also a matter of education. Polaris II offers a unique experience in undergraduate research that will inspire and prepare a new generation of arctic researchers. Further, it will convey the importance of the Arctic to the public and to policy-makers, providing them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. The Polaris Project will achieve a broad and lasting impact by linking interdisciplinary scientific research to innovative undergraduate education and imaginative public outreach. In addition to providing a transformative experience for the participants in the annual Siberian field course, Polaris II will educate large numbers of undergraduate students who complete the Polaris-affiliated on-campus courses. The project will also engage K-12 students and teachers through direct and sustained interactions with Polaris PIs and broad dissemination of education and outreach materials. Finally, Polaris II will inform a diverse public audience about the state of the Arctic, ecosystems research, and global climate change. Approaches to project outreach include expansion of the Polaris website and associated blog (www.thepolarisproject.org) and the development of an online seminar series for undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and public participants. The production and wide distribution of multimedia videos addressing key arctic science themes will further expand the reach of the project, as will the inclusion of a writer in the 2011 field course with the objective of publishing a book about the Arctic, climate change, and the Polaris Project experience. As a resource for the scientific and education communities, Polaris data will be freely available through the project website and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).

However, this can be complicated because these temperatures are related to both changing meteorology (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) and hydrology (e.g., instream flows and lateral inflows). The ability to predict climate related changes on instream thermal regimes in Arctic streams is limited by the minimal understanding of key processes and the availability of data to quantify heat fluxes. We hypothesized that the dominant heat fluxes within Arctic streams are similar to those in temperate climates but that the relative magnitude of the heat fluxes differ, and that quantification of lateral inflows is key in predicting water temperatures. We first found that temperate-zone and Arctic river temperatures are controlled by similar processes, with a few key differences. The differences, however, depended on location within the watershed and hydrologic condition. In general, solar radiation and other radiative exchanges controlled river temperatures at the most downstream and upstream locations in the watershed. However, there were other key heat fluxes in the upper locations that varied with instream flows. During large rain events and high river flows, the relatively steep terrain in the upper portion of the watershed delivers water efficiently and surface and groundwater inflows from the watershed become an important control on river temperatures (See King et al., 2016 Water Resources Research, doi:10.1002/2015WR017965 for more information). During dry periods when the river flow is low, we found that the exchange of water from the channel to the cold river bottom sediments and back became important and kept the river temperatures cool enough for fish (See King et al., 2019 Water Resources Research, for more information). In temperate-zone rivers these low flow conditions tend to create conditions that are too warm for the native fish, but in arctic rivers with frozen sediments below, this channel-sediment exchange keeps the river cool even during warm, dry conditions.

Including these 34, there are presently 58 published radon-deficit estimates of k, the air-sea gas transfer velocity in the Arctic Ocean; 52 of these estimates were derived from water covered by 10% sea ice or more. The average value of K collected since 2011 is 4.0 +- 1.2 m d-1 This exceeds the quadratic wind speed prediction of weighted kws = 2.85 m d-1 with mean weighted wind speed of 6.4 m s-1. We show how ice cover changes the mixed-layer radon budget, and yields an “effective gas transfer velocity”. We use these 58 estimates to statistically evaluate the suitability of a wind speed parameterization for k, when the ocean surface is ice covered. Whereas the six profiles taken from the open ocean indicate a statistically good fit to wind speed parameterizations, the same parameterizations could not reproduce k from the sea ice zone. We conclude that techniques for estimating k in the open ocean cannot be similarly applied to determine k in the presence of sea ice. The magnitude of k through gaps in the ice may reach high values as ice cover increases, possibly as a result of focused turbulence dissipation at openings in the free surface. These 58 profiles are presently the most complete set of estimates of k across seasons and variable ice cover; as dissolved tracer budgets, they reflect air-sea gas exchange with no impact from air-ice gas exchange."," Including these 34, there are presently 58 published radon-deficit estimates of k, the air-sea gas transfer velocity in the Arctic Ocean; 52 of these estimates were derived from water covered by 10% sea ice or more",adc mentioned in acknowledgements & in body of the text with link to dataset,

The water isotope parameter deuterium excess, a moisture source proxy, can serve as a tracer to help understand hydrological changes due to sea ice loss. However, unlocking the sea ice change signal of isotopes from ice cores requires understanding how sea ice changes impact deuterium excess, which is unknown. Here we present the first isotope data linking a gradient of sea ice extents to oceanic water vapor deuterium excess values. Initial loss of sea ice extent leads to lower deuterium excess moisture sources, and then values progressively increase with further ice loss. Our new process-based interpretation suggests that past rapid (1–3 years) Greenland ice core changes in deuterium excess during warming might not be the result of abrupt atmospheric circulation shifts, but rather gradual loss of sea ice extent at northern latitude moisture sources.

Ecosystem respiration was measured using opaque chambers, and soil CO2 concentrations were measured using stainless-steel gas wells inserted throughout the active layer. Gas samples for 14C analysis were collected monthly. Ecosystem respiration, CO2 in ambient air and root-respired CO2 were captured on molecular sieve traps. Roots were manually extracted, rinsed and incubated in CO2-free air for 24 h. Soil gas was collected in pre-evacuated canisters using flow-restricting capillaries. Concentrations of organic C along the soil profile were measured by elemental analysis. For 14C analysis, CO2 was released from molecular sieve traps by heating at 650 degrees C for 45 min or extracted from canisters on a vacuum line, purified cryogenically and reduced to graphite through zinc reduction and analysed at UC Irvine's W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility28. Soil samples were first combusted to CO2 in pre-combusted, evacuated quartz tubes with cupric oxide for 2 h at 900 degrees C.

Ice streams are bounded by abrupt transitions in speed called shear margins. Some shear margins are fixed by subglacial topography, but others are thought to be self‐organizing, evolving by thermal feedback to ice viscosity and basal drag which govern the stress balance of ice sheets. Resistive stresses (and properties governing shear‐margin formation) manifest nonuniquely at the surface, motivating the use of subsurface observations to constrain ice sheet models. In this study, we use ice‐penetrating radar data to evaluate three three-dimensional thermomechanical models of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, focusing on model reproductions of ice temperature (a primary control on viscosity) and subsurface velocity. Data/model agreement indicates elevated temperatures in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream margins, with depth‐averaged temperatures between 2 degrees celsius and 6 degrees celsius warmer in the southeast margin compared to ice in streaming flow, driven by vertical heat transport rather than shear heating.

This dataset was collected as part of an interdisciplinary human/ecosystems resilience project in the Islands of the Four Mountains that included the study of hazards caused by earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. The Four Mountains island group provide an excellent opportunity to assess the development of prehistoric human adaptations to geological hazards and environmental change because they lie within a zone of high catastrophic potential. As examples, Mt. Cleveland, has erupted explosively more than 20 times in the last decade and during the time of prehistoric human habitation. The Aleutian plate boundary is the site of four earthquakes having a magnitude greater than 8 and dozens with magnitudes greater than 7, and these have generated tsunamis historically and prehistorically. 
The Four Mountain prehistoric sites are little studied but are highly significant for interpreting the role of geologic hazards on human migration and societal development in the Aleutian archipelago. The 2-year project (2014-2015) included a team of professional and student archaeologists, geologists, ecologists, and zoologists. Extensive datasets, in addition to the tsunami dataset here, include radiocarbon, geological, paleoenvironmental, and cultural data. These data yield novel insights into the record of geological hazards, human coping mechanisms, changing subsistence, and adaptations during the prehistoric and European contact periods. Additionally, assessing the degree to which geological hazards in the Aleutian archipelago disrupted prehistoric human and ecological systems has important lessons for current inhabitants of the northern Pacific Rim."," All observations will be published in special issue with other collaborators on the project (citation available after publication), or can be obtained from the author at macinnes@geology",,

Furthermore, research suggests that the current warming trend will continue, and it is therefore important to study current environmental systems in order to understand the complicated dynamics of warming and response (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007). Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change, and are therefore a critical area to study (Svendsen & Mangerud, 1997). The purpose of this paper is to investigate water discharge and suspended sediment flux patterns in a proglacial meltwater stream flowing from the Linnébreen glacier in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and to characterize sediment storage in the proglacial system. Changes in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) act as sensitive indicators of interactions between the glacier, climate, and landscape (Strzelecki, 2009). This work uses statistical methods to provide a framework with which to qualitatively describe subseasonal forcings behind discharge and SSC changes in the proglacial meltwater stream. Precipitation is found to be a primary forcer of both discharge and suspended sediment concentration changes. Furthermore, a subseasonal split was determined midway through the monitoring period, described by lessening lag times between discharge peaks and SSC peaks, and indicating a continued maturation of the entire system. Continued research of this nature will contribute to the ongoing effort to characterize the dynamics of the Linnébreen basin and to continuing research on Arctic glacier responses to the effects of climate change."," The purpose of this paper is to investigate water discharge and suspended sediment flux patterns in a proglacial meltwater stream flowing from the Linnébreen glacier in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and to characterize sediment storage in the proglacial system",honors paper,

Evidence from Arctic and North Atlantic historical and literary sources and archaeological sites reveals frequent use of marine mammals by prehistoric hunters and scavengers and Norse settlers, but details about the uses of whale, seal, and walrus are unquantified, broad and approximate. These northern regions are critically important ecosystems to current North American economies and interests. They were home to the world's earliest whaling industries and support ongoing sealing and whaling traditions. However, we know almost nothing about the origins and scale of whale, seal, and walrus use in these once fertile waters. Given the complexity of marine food webs in regions like the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, reconstruction of preindustrial or 'pristine' maritime ecosystems is critical in modern restoration efforts and for the preservation and sustainable use of fish and mammal populations today. Without clear knowledge of ancient and early historic marine mammal populations, we cannot gauge what healthy marine mammal populations would look like today. The fourteen-member research team, from the disciplines of humanities, history, archaeology, biology, genetics and others, aims to investigate the deep history of whale, seal, and walrus use in the Eastern Arctic and North Atlantic. This research will span the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age (beginning around 800 CE), through the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000-1250), and concluding with the Little Ice Age at the end of the Middle Ages (1300-1500). In addition to assessing the social, cultural, and economic importance of marine mammal use among Norse populations, the research study uses cutting-edge genetic and chemical analyses to provide a far better understanding of marine mammal populations in the Arctic and North Atlantic before the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting beginning in the sixteenth century. Evidence from houses, burials, and trading sites, from current archaeological excavations and museum collections, as well as histories, sagas, maps, illuminated manuscripts and other traditional sources of knowledge, are combined with scientific approaches to ancient animal bones and the genetic stories that they can tell. This project will build interdisciplinary connections across the social and natural sciences, will bring together researchers and students from six countries and eleven academic institutions and museums, and will employ the most current technologies and scholarship in genetics, biology, digital humanities, and zooarchaeology. The research team hopes to uncover new evidence about the marine animals that populated medieval seas, and the manners in which medieval Icelanders, Greenlanders, and others encountered and exploited these mammals. The project team will produce scholarly articles, translations, new genetic and zooarchaeological data sets, will participate in academic conferences and public presentations, and will design both curricular and museum materials to communicate our results to a broader audience. Undergraduate and graduate students will be guided through transdisciplinary research collaborations in the US and abroad. Finally, the team scientists think that their results may also aid colleagues in the natural sciences in reconstruction of ancient seas, climates, animal populations, and environmental change, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability. This project seeks answers to fundamental questions about medieval marine mammal exploitation, focusing on Norse uses of whales, seals and walruses in the North Atlantic prior to 1500 CE. In a region dominated by charismatic Arctic megafauna, where modern industrial whaling was born and where current whaling and sealing attract global attention, the prehistory and early history of marine mammal use remain unclear in its scale and purpose. The researchers' transdisciplinary approach employs Local and Traditional Knowledge (LTK), digital humanities, environmental histories, and innovative technologies of genetic analysis to new and existing sea mammal archaeofaunal assemblages to produce a holistic long-term perspective on the social, cultural, and economic history of marine mammal use in medieval northern Europe. This research spans the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age and the Medieval Climatic Optimum, through the Little Ice Age onset in the high Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. The length of the project survey period (+ 700 years) will result in samples across a broad range of time and space, which allows the science team to contextualize newly-generated aDNA marine mammal data across several documented periods of major climate change in the North Atlantic and Subarctic. The project will also provide a far better understanding of marine mammal dynamics in these regions prior to the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting impacts beginning in the sixteenth century. The project utilizes: 1) a new integration with the rich medieval written record for Iceland aided by digital and environmental humanities approaches; 2) a greatly expanded zooarchaeological database created since the International Polar Year (IPY) by the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) research cooperative; 3) newly expanded capabilities in ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, allowing species-level identification on a wide range of otherwise unidentifiable sea mammal bones; 4) new data management and visualization tools providing more effective cross disciplinary communication and wider public engagement through cooperation with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NISDC) and NABO project management system; and 5) facilities for wide transdisciplinary dissemination of results through the Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (IHOPE) program as part of the Future Earth global change initiative. This project will build capacity for scientific collaboration and data management, dissemination, and visualization, while improving species-level identification, exceeding current capabilities of simple morphometric analysis or collagen fingerprinting of sea mammal bones from archaeological contexts and museum collections. In addition, it offers the promise to create important new bodies of evidence for a range of scholarly disciplines across a broad temporal and geographical series of case studies. Finally, the proposed project's use of extant data sets - textual, archaeological, biological - may provide an innovative new model for transdisciplinary analysis of premodern marine mammal use that can be applied across the North Atlantic and circumpolar Arctic. The researchers hope to establish a historical baseline of marine mammal use that reveals a more complete economic and ecological portrait of the Norse North Atlantic. Through collaborations with North Pacific and Western Arctic colleagues, the research team's work will complete a circumpolar perspective of prehistoric and early historic marine mammal exploitation. By answering fundamental questions of marine mammal use, this research has the potential to provide context or evidence for lost genetic diversity among key marine species, now under pressure from both natural and human drivers of environmental change. This integrative approach, including collaboration of scholars and students from twelve institutions across North America and Europe, also provides new models and innovative methodologies for transdisciplinary research in the social sciences and humanities, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability."," The project team will produce scholarly articles, translations, new genetic and zooarchaeological data sets, will participate in academic conferences and public presentations, and will design both curricular and museum materials to communicate our results to a broader audience",,

This project compares the evolution of state-indigenous systems among the Tlingit and Inuit peoples of Southeast and Northwest Alaska and Canada. Specifically, the project analyzes how the creation of Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) business corporations in 1971 transformed institutional arrangements between Natives, state governments, ecosystems, and regional-global economies, and has contributed to particular outcomes in indigenous groups' biocultural health as measured by the sustainable livelihoods assessment. ANCSA corporations, as distinct ethnic and placed based sociocultural institutions, hold unique perspectives (in contrast to conventional corporations and their shareholders) on the relative importance of the various forms of capital - including natural, physical, political, financial, human, social and cultural capital - that in combination support sustainable livelihoods and mitigate against vulnerabilities from a variety of ecological, political-economic, and socio-cultural stresses. In their development ANCSA corporations have sought to balance these various forms of capital in significantly different ways leading to a variety of outcomes, from increased financial, natural resources, and social security to increased economic vulnerability and environmental degradation. To understand the diversity of outcomes the project evaluates four dimensions of indigenous-state institutional governance as a framework for comparative analysis of sustainable development: 1) land selection, management, and property rights (natural and financial capital); 2) resource conservation and development (natural and physical capital); 3) sociopolitical organization, leadership and inequality (human, political, and social capital); and 4) cultural conservation and revitalization (social and cultural capital). While analytically separable, the project shows how, in practice, these four dimensions interrelate on a variety of levels which contribute (or fail to contribute) to the biocultural diversity and health of indigenous communities. Data are drawn from reviews of the published and unpublished literature, analysis of demographic and socioeconomic data, confidential interviews with Alaska Natives, ANCSA corporate leaders, and other stakeholders, and participant observation. Local Native communities are involved in all phases of the research and the results will be published and shared with the participating Tlingit and Inupiaq corporations and communities and used to better understand the historical role their corporations have played in promoting sustainable livelihoods, and how effort might be best directed to insure healthy development in the future. The broader significance of this inquiry is that it will advance our understanding of sustainable livelihoods and biocultural health by addressing key cross-cultural dimensions of indigenous-state relations and policy-making in North America and beyond. Alaska Native Corporations are unique hybrid institutions with a 35-year track record of development. Other indigenous peoples, including Tlingit and Inuit peoples of Canada, have been interested in the Alaska model, but this project is the first to provide a multidimensional comparative study of Alaska Native corporations as total cultural institutions rather than simple business corporations. In this era of rapid environmental and social change and expanding conflicts and stress over environmental resources and sociopolitical and cultural rights, this study will provide a useful framework and benchmark for assessing how states and indigenous peoples can best achieve sustainable livelihoods in the twenty-first century without sacrificing cultural or environmental integrity.","c("" Data are drawn from reviews of the published and unpublished literature, analysis of demographic and socioeconomic data, confidential interviews with Alaska Natives, ANCSA corporate leaders, and other stakeholders, and participant observation"", "" Local Native communities are involved in all phases of the research and the results will be published and shared with the participating Tlingit and Inupiaq corporations and communities and used to better understand the historical role their corporations have played in promoting sustainable livelihoods, and how effort might be best directed to insure healthy development in the future""

The additional instruments will record velocity, pressure, temperature, and salinity below 2200 m. These would be the first ever long time-series measurements in the deep Arctic Ocean's Canada Basin, and would provide important insight into the most unexplored regions of the Arctic Ocean. The research of deep observations of the Canada Basin, which has the largest volume of all the Arctic basins and contains the oldest deep water, will be a vital component of the snapshot in time of the state of the Arctic Ocean between 2007 and 2009. The study will provide a foundation for a better assessment of Arctic Climate variability through knowledge of the deepest waters which serve as a marker for climatic transitions.

Current bias error estimates are included in archives. However, many issues are not yet accounted for. Hence, it is very timely to ask the science question: What are the different types of uncertainty which impact the measurement accuracy of sea ice thickness, its distribution, and resulting volume? This project developed a collection of ""demonstration papers"" to identify and support solutions for the integration of data sets across multiple scales. The essence of the problem comes down to the interpretation of data collected by one instrument with one footprint size versus another instrument with a different footprint. Plots of sea ice thickness frequency distribution serve as a “Rosetta Stone” within the sea ice community to communicate sea ice thickness information between scales. Spatial aliasing distorts this communication across the scales by introducing false peaks, like garbled language, into our Rosetta-Stone communicator. The problem introduces a resolution error as a function of the size (length scale) and shape (waveform) of an instrument’s footprint. We are finding that instruments with measurement footprints which exceed sea ice features incorporate spatial aliasing into their thickness records. Aliasing occurs whenever deep narrow features are smoothened into wider shallower features. The integrated volume is not initially impacted and hence the problem is accepted as a small second-order effect for individual instruments. But the conserved ice volume is not an archived data value. The archived data values are thickness and associated frequency distributions which are important model parameters for heat fluxes at the air-sea interface. The problem is only now becoming relevant as geolocation errors diminish to the benefit of coincident measurement campaigns. Specifically, aliasing increases when we combine measurements from different instruments at different scales. This is a problem that needs to be addressed because sea ice scientists are being asked by non-scientists and policy makers for higher data quality so that they can make critical decisions about global human activities. Spatial aliasing is a ubiquitous problem that is not limited to sea ice thickness nor is it limited to instrument measurements. The problem becomes most pronounced for strongly non-Gaussian (skewed) distributions such as sea ice and snow thickness. In particular, cases with strong bi-modal distribution can incur resolution errors which impact large-scale sea ice volume estimates."," This project developed a collection of ""demonstration papers"" to identify and support solutions for the integration of data sets across multiple scales",We're not the primary repo,

OsmoSampler systems from eight lakes in the Mackenzie River delta and North Richards Island
regions of the Northwest Territories of Canada. Secondary goals for the field program included
collection of water and sediment samples from the same lakes, and deployment of new
OsmoSampler systems in three of the same lakes, as well as new sites of interest in the
Tuktoyaktuk region. Even despite poor weather in the outer delta and a cut line to an
OsmoSampler, all sampling systems that were deployed in August 2016 were successfully
recovered, as were sediment and water samples from the same lakes. These recoveries involved
numerous small boat trips to Inuvik area lakes and three helicopter days (supported by
collaborator Lance Lesack's PCSP award). New OsmoSamplers were deployed in three lakes: Lake 520 in the Inuvik area lakes, Swiss Cheese Lake in the outer delta, and North Head 1 lake
at the northern most point of North Richards Island. An additional OsmoSampler was deployed
in a deep hole by Scott Dallimore during operations off Tuktoyaktuk. During the field program,

It was noted in a 1975 paper in Science by Kennett and Shackleton that the flood of fresh water down Mississippi River was interrupted at about 13 kilo annums (ka), even though there was no reason to suspect a pause in glacial ice melt.  The Kennett and Shackleton hypothesis led to the expectation that as glacial ice continued to melt and retreat northward, at some point eastern outlets for meltwater must have opened to the St. Lawrence system around the time the Mississippi flood ended.  However, researchers looked for decades for the signal of low δ 18 O in planktonic foraminifera off eastern Canada, to no avail.  The only other logical direction for meltwater would have been to the north through Mackenzie River.  Two piston cores recovered during USCGC Healy Cruise 2013 near Mackenzie River have the low δ 18 O signal of the flood beginning at 12.9 ka according to radiocarbon dating.  Those flood waters most likely reduced the surface ocean salinity in the Nordic Seas, reducing the production of deep water, and thereby reducing the northward the flux of warm salty waters that account for the temperate climate in northern Europe today.   This flood was most likely the trigger for the younger Dryas cooling.  Analytical data associated with this project, and especially those data published in Keigwin et al.

The Census Long Form Survey historically provided much of the data for measuring social and economic conditions in the United States. Its replacement with the American Community Survey (ACS) after the 2000 Census has raised serious concerns about whether Census data continue to provide accurate measures of well-being in rural Alaska communities, at a time when the region faces unprecedented environmental and socio-economic change. The project addresses the uncertainty with ACS data by developing a new set of social, economic, and cultural indicators with increased capability to detect differences at local scales.  Specific objectives include: (1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with respect to one or more indicators. The project pursues these objectives through modeling and statistical analyses of multiple primary data sources, including individual interview data from the ACS and the previous censuses in cooperation with the United States Census Bureau. Project outputs include a set of socio-economic indicators with improved reliability over published ACS figures that can help state and local governments and non-governmental organizations allocate funds, plan, and evaluate social service and economic development programs. A pioneering application of data assimilation with a social system model aids arctic social observing system design by revealing highest priority targets for new data collection for observing and understanding social change in arctic communities.","c(""  Specific objectives include: (1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with respect to one or more indicators"",

Chemical conversion of Hg in snowpack from non-volatile forms to gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) can lead to substantial degassing of Hg from snow, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric deposition. Contrary to the GEM chemistry seen in the midlatitude snowpack, preliminary observations from Toolik Lake, on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, provide evidence that photochemical GEM formation and degassing are suppressed in tundra snow and that for much of the winter, interstitial GEM is actually converted into non-volatile Hg. These patterns result in extended periods when interstitial snowpack air is depleted in GEM. If confirmed, this chemistry would likely signify a net transfer of atmospheric GEM to snow or underlying soils, thereby increasing Hg deposition to tundra ecosystems. Proposed project objectives are to investigate (1) the frequency and underlying processes that determine GEM depletion and formation in arctic snowpack and tundra soils; (2) the degree to which GEM dynamics cause vertical Hg exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and (3) how these processes provide additional sources − or sinks − of Hg via atmosphere-surface transfer and snowmelt input. GEM concentrations in soils, snow, and air, as well as vertical exchanges, will be characterized at Toolik Field Station. Measurements will be made by means of a snow-sampling manifold system allowing for fully automated and continuous all-winter measurements of trace gases at multiple depths in the undisturbed snowpack and the atmosphere. These experiments will be supplemented by flux chamber measurements to assess the contribution of the underlying tundra soils. Other trace gas observations, and chemical characterization of soil, snow, melt water, and soil water will be incorporated to assess the environmental and biogeochemical controls on GEM dynamics and the Hg budget. This proposed research will leverage ongoing Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) projects at the Toolik Field station, providing linkages between in-snow processes, tundra soil and freshwater biogeochemical cycling, pollution import into the Arctic, and ecosystem processes. The project will directly involve high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. It will expand an existing partnership with local high school chemistry classes through research presentations in classrooms, laboratory tours, and data analyses using study results.

Parks Canada provided Kaplan the vessel, its crew, and polar bear monitors free of charge to accomplish the project. The goal of the fieldwork was to assess the stability of a Middle Dorset (800 CE to 1,000 CE; CE meaning Common Era or the equivalent of 1,216 years ago to 1,016 years ago as of the present date: 2016 CE) archaeological site (Avayalik-1, House 1), located on an outer island 25 miles south of the tip of Labrador. Researchers investigated the vulnerability of Avayalik-1 to rising sea levels and the thawing of permafrost, with the intention of contributing to discussions on how to assess, monitor, and preserve such sites. This information is of great interest to the scientific community, culture resource managers, and also to the indigenous residents who are in many cases the decedents of the original occupants.  Avayalik-1, House 1 is a scientifically unique Middle Dorset site. It was last investigated in 1978, and yielded organic artifacts and faunal remains unsurpassed in quantity and preservation by any other Labrador Middle Dorset sites due to the fact the cultural deposits were permanently frozen. However, given the current warming of the Arctic and the rapid thawing of permafrost, many Arctic heritage sites thought for decades to be safe while in the frozen ground are under threat. Avayalik-1 is such a site.  The dataset contains specific archaeology site locations, photographs, fieldnotes, and an archaeology collection inventory. The information is being used to assess the stability of Avayalik-1, a Paleoeskimo site of importance to understanding the prehistory of Labrador, Canada. According to the terms of the research permit, the data collected must be deposited with Parks Canada, the archaeology office of the Province of Labrador-Newfoundland, and Nunatsiavut Archaeology Office. The data can be accessed through those repositories only, for Canada considers exact locations and the contents of archaeological sites protected information.

The overarching goals of this project are to use the sampling power of the ITEX Network to quantify changes in phenology, vegetation, and ecosystem properties that have occurred in tundra over the past 10-15 years in response to climate change and experimental warming, and to use the Network as the foundation for monitoring and prediction of future changes. Among the earliest signals of climate warming in the Arctic have been changes in the seasonal timing of life cycle events (phenology). Plants are leafing, flowering, and fruiting earlier than ever recorded. Because phenology and physiology are tightly coupled, ecosystem functions such as primary production, as well as the outcome of competition depend on phenological responses. Species phenological and physiological responses to warming differ, causing changes in community composition, biodiversity, and ecosystem function. However, in contrast to phenology, change in community composition is difficult to detect and ascribe to a particular phenomenon. Changes in phenology and species abundance being reported across the Arctic are consistent with the findings of the long-term experimental warming of the ITEX network, a plot-scale, nondestructive, warming experiment conducted across the tundra biome beginning in 1990. Remote sensing analyses have also detected earlier greening and increased biomass across polar regions, but cannot readily identify the basis for changes in community composition, can only infer function, and can say nothing about community trajectories. Intellectual merit: The ITEX network was specifically designed to study phenology and community composition, and has also been used effectively to study ecosystem processes. The ITEX network is perfectly positioned for an intensive, comprehensive study of decadal-scale changes in phenology, community composition, and ecosystem function in response to background climate change, and has the added value of long-term experimental warming. The baseline data and sampling power of the ITEX network and its experimental approach are unparalleled. We will compare the results of a renewed field campaign of phenology and plant community composition measurements on warmed and control plots during the IPY with our historical data from 10-15 years ago. The investigators will run two workshops to synthesize the long-term phenological and community changes observed across the network. Furthermore, a new suite of minimally invasive measurements will cross compare indices of ecosystem function - including: leaf, litter, and soil nutrients; isotopic composition; and secondary chemistry - in the control and warmed plots across the network. The long-term nature of these experiments and the global coverage of the coordinated network will lead to unique insights regarding the tundra response to past, ongoing, and future climate changes. Broader Impacts: This study will provide research opportunities and training for two young investigators, a postdoctoral fellow, and graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The investigators will also actively seek participation of underrepresented residents of the community at Barrow, Alaska, and have incorporated public awareness components about the teleconnections between the Arctic and the Earth System in the communities of Anchorage, AK and Miami, FL. The findings of this work will be published as broadly synthetic works of international interest. Because of teleconnections, findings of this circumpolar project will be of general importance to decision makers. Finally, meetings of the ITEX network will provide a learning experience rich in synthetic understanding of topics from a variety of international and cultural viewpoints. Relevance to IPY: This project meets the goals of the IPY program as an international network with a strong research, networking and outreach components studying effects of warming and climate variability on ecosystems in the Arctic. The ITEX network has been specifically endorsed by the IPY Secretariat as project #188 as demonstrating a high level of adherence to IPY themes and goals. A related endorsement of the Circumarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity (CAT-B) initiative, an offshoot of ITEX, is further evidence of the relevance of this program to IPY.

The GBMS employs remote sensing to detect and measure molecular rotational emission lines. The species observed are used in monitoring and measuring the chemical and physical state of the polar atmosphere, which undergoes rapid changes during the Winter-Spring period of active observation. The focus is on those species and processes related to stratospheric ozone depletion. Among the advantages of the GBMS technique are that observations are not dependent on sunlight, and that pressure-broadened spectral line shapes can be measured with great accuracy, allowing vertical distribution profiles to be deduced from deconvolution of the observed line shapes. The species to be observed are ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric acid, and hydrogen cyanide, and perhaps chlorine monoxide. The observations will continue a series of Arctic observations of the middle atmosphere carried out by the principal investigator and colleagues in the early springs of 2002, 2003, and 2009.

An important part of Arctic ecosystems and Aboriginal livelihood, wild reindeer have been monitored by scientists for almost 50 years. During this time, herds have exhibited large changes in size and these changes have been recorded in almost all herds across the animal's range. The increase in the number of wild reindeer 20-30 years ago was almost universally followed by a significant population loss in the last decade. In addition, recent monitoring revealed substantial shifts in the distribution of wild populations. The decline in wild reindeer is likely related to natural cycles and changes in the Arctic environment caused by climate change and increased anthropogenic activity. In order to explain the observed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer, it is necessary to collect long-term and seasonal observations. The Taimyr Reindeer Herd (TRH) is both the largest and the longest monitored wild reindeer herd in Eurasia. The Extreme North Agricultural Research Institute in Norilsk, Russia, has observed the TRH since 1969. Only a limited amount of the information on the TRH has been released, digitized, processed, analyzed or published. Much of the information is held in single-copy paper in locations and under conditions that threaten its longevity. The proposed project aims to digitize all available past records concerning the Taimyr wild reindeer populations and develop related datasets on climate and habitat over the decades of observation.  The Taimyr Reindeer Migration Reanalysis (TAMARA) project will be based upon a collaborative and integrated interdisciplinary international network of reindeer experts, arctic researchers, and geospatial scientists. The project is designed to build a comprehensive and openly available information system that will provide insight into the historical relationship between humans, climate, environment, and reindeer. Building on both international and local experiences the investigators will implement a major data digitization and dissemination effort that will be a considerable contribution to the polar cyberinfrastructure pertaining to Arctic terrestrial mammals. The project has the following objectives: 1) Retrieve, digitize, archive, transfer, process and publish historical observational data collected between 1969 and 2009, document relevant methodologies, and develop appropriate metadata; 2) Develop value-added data products resulting from the (re)analysis of historical spatial migration patterns of the TRH; and 3) Contribute to developing polar spatial cyberinfrastructure by creating a comprehensive and open data visualization and data dissemination system. The TAMARA project will be an integral part of the worldwide network of reindeer observation programs.

Along this ice margin the width of the ablation zone is only about 8 km. The emergence and melting of old ice in the ablation zone creates a surface layer of dust that was originally deposited with snowfall high on the ice sheet. This debris cover is augmented by locally derived wind-blown sediment. Subsequently, the surface dust particles often aggregate together to form centimetre-scale clumps that melt into the ice, creating cryoconite holes. The debris in the cryoconite holes becomes hidden from sunlight, raising the area-averaged albedo relative to surfaces with uniform debris cover. Spectral and broadband albedos were obtained for snow, ice hummocks, debris-covered ice, cryoconite-studded ice and barren tundra surfaces. Broadband ice albedos varied from 0.2 (for ice with heavy loading of uniform debris) to 0.6 (for ice hummocks with cryoconite holes).

Studies of lacustrine sediment deposition and watershed dynamics allow for interpretation or calibration of the annual sediment yields and the connection to climatic controls. Sediment trap studies undertaken on Linnévatnet, a High Arctic glacial-fed lake on the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago, since 2003 provide a critical link from modern processes to the laminated sediment record. In the summer of 2010 a total of 31 traps were collected that were deployed in the summer of 2009. Their locations in relation to the inlet of the glacial stream Linnéelva range from proximal (.4km away) to distal (3.3km). Instrumentation in the Linné Valley, including time lapse cameras, temperature loggers, snow trees, and weather station data help facilitate understanding of climatic controls on glacial melt and stream discharge. Two sedimentation events occurred in the summer/fall of 2009, accounting for 25% of total sediment accumulation. Spring 2010 sedimentation began on 6/15 with an event that accounted for 12.5% of total yearly sediment accumulation. This was followed by the most significant event of the year from 6/24-6/30. This event accounted for 50% of the total sediment accumulation and was driven by the nival melt. Two further events were recorded by the intervalometer, each accounting for 6.3% of total accumulation. The first event was the result of settling of fine grained particles and the second was a distinct event driven by solar radiation and temperature. The nival melt is determined to be the dominant hydrologic event in the Linné valley and responsible for the majority of sedimentation in Linnévatnet. The timing and intensity of this melt event is controlled primarily by melting degree days. Further study is needed to determine the validity of using Linnévatnet’s varved sediment for paleoclimate reconstructions.",The first event was the result of settling of fine grained particles and the second was a distinct event driven by solar radiation and temperature,,

Studies conducted over the last decade indicate that the Arctic is both a sensitive indicator of climate change and an active driver of climate variability. As evidenced by the strikingly low summer sea ice extent estimates recorded since August 2007 and large anomalies in liquid fresh water content (manifested by upper-ocean salinity), significant changes in the Arctic appear to be underway now. It is critical that we continue to observe the Arctic during this time of rapid evolution to quantify the physical changes that are occurring, to better understand their causes, and to assess their impacts on the Arctic Ocean climate system. We will construct and deploy 6 ITP instrument systems annually throughout the Arctic Ocean to acquire, process and make the data from these instruments freely and immediately available to all interested parties to support science and operational activities via our project web site, the GTS and the Argo float program data assembly centers. Improvements to sensor design and added variables will be tested during deployments to increase the platform lifetime and expand the measurement suite on board the ITP.

Lake Linné, located on the west coast of Spitsbergen, receives melt water from the Linné glacier, located 8 km up valley. The focus of the investigation is to better understand climatic effects on yearly sedimentation, and to better characterize annual variation in the sediment record. Sediment traps were deployed at five sites (each site having traps at varying depths), from July 2003 to August 2004, in order to facilitate spatial and temporal understanding of sedimentation occurring in the lake. The collected sediment was sub-sampled and analyzed using a Coulter LS230 Particle Analyzer in order to characterize textural changes both temporally in each trap, as well as spatially throughout the lake. Sedimentation rates calculated from the recovered yearlong sediment traps ranged from 277 to 28 mg/cm2/yr (1.5 to 0.15 mm/yr) from the most proximal to distal sites respectively. These sedimentation rates compare well to calculated average rates of sedimentation based on thickness of lacustrine sediment in the lake. Changes in grain size recorded in the sediment traps throughout the year demonstrate a strong peak in grain size associated with a spring melt event. These melt-out deposits are substantially coarser (median grain size = 53 µm) than any other sediment deposited during the year, including deposits associated with a high precipitation and discharge event (median grain size < 16 µm). This suggests that the spring melt sediment is deposited by different mechanism, most likely overland flow during the spring melt. Weather events (rain and solar insolation) affected the grain size of sediment deposited proximally in the lake; median grain size is strongly correlated to discharge from the inlet stream in the late summer."," The collected sediment was sub-sampled and analyzed using a Coulter LS230 Particle Analyzer in order to characterize textural changes both temporally in each trap, as well as spatially throughout the lake",,

If thawed, the decomposition of this aged organic carbon will release the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, fueling a positive feedback between permafrost thaw and global warming. The term “carbon bomb” has been used to describe this process, primarily in the popular press but also within journals such as Nature and Science. Numerous studies have shown extensive permafrost thaw and degradation in the Arctic, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported from the mouths of large Arctic rivers – which are expected to integrate processes and changes occurring through their watersheds – has been shown to be predominantly modern. This raises the question, where is the ancient organic carbon that is mobilized from permafrost degradation and the deepening of the active layer?

Research supported by this grant highlighted fundamental new insights into the fate of permafrost thaw derived DOC in Arctic inland waters. A major focus was placed on the period of maximum permafrost thaw in the fall at the time of deepest active layer depth. Four full field campaigns were undertaken examining the field sites in the Kolyma watershed (Siberia). Our results highlighted mobilization of ancient (>20,000 ybp) DOC in streams draining from permafrost landscapes. We showed for the first time direct utilization of ancient (>20,000 ybp) permafrost thaw DOC in stream networks along with concurrent shifts in the molecular structure of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) resulting in the remaining DOM looking similar to modern sources of DOM from terrestrial inputs in the Kolyma Basin. Additionally, microbial demand was supported by progressively younger carbon downstream through the Kolyma fluvial network, with predominantly modern carbon pools subsidizing microorganisms in large rivers and main-stem waters. Our results add significant weight to the argument that any permafrost inputs will be rapidly degraded in small thaw streams and the loss of molecular signature along with high biolability of permafrost derived DOC makes the permafrost inputs difficult to study using samples from major rivers. Permafrost was shown to act as a significant and preferentially degradable source of bioavailable carbon in Arctic freshwaters, which is likely to increase as permafrost thaw intensifies causing positive climate feedbacks in response to on-going climate change."," The term “carbon bomb” has been used to describe this process, primarily in the popular press but also within journals such as Nature and Science",,

By establishing a relationship between modern sedimentation and measured environmental conditions, we hope to calibrate the late Holocene sediment record found in Lake Linné. Since 2003 sediment trap moorings at five locations in the lake have provided proximal to distal records of overall lake sedimentation. Each mooring also had multiple traps positioned at various water depths, providing insights into the sediment distribution processes in the basin. Trap data show a clear proximal to distal decrease in sediment accumulation and grain size. The data also show an increase in sediment accumulation and grain size as water depth increases. In the most proximal traps, the finest sediment is found at the traps bottom in a very thin layer. It is followed by an abrupt increase in particle size, which grades to the coarsest sediment found in each trap. During May of 2007, prior to the spring melt, sediment traps were deployed, and an automated camera was set-up to take pictures of the inflow into the lake. The spring traps do not record any of the fine sediment found in the bottom of the yearly traps, suggesting that the majority of sediment in the yearlong traps was deposited during/after the spring melt. In addition to the spring traps and camera, snow sensors and meteorological data associate the abrupt increase in particle size with the loss of the snow pack during the spring melt. After the loss of the snowpack, other pulses of coarse sediment are linked to rainfall events in the valley. In contrast, the sediment collected at the top of the traps in July and August, the height of the ablation season, has a finer texture (fine silt and clay). These findings are consistent with data from previous years, suggesting that for systems like Lake Linné, silt laminations are related to high stream discharge events, resulting from the loss of snow pack and large rain events. The annual clay layer thickness is related to the amount of annual glacier ablation, indicating that the thickness of the clay laminations in the lake cores may be the best proxy for reconstructing late Holocene glacier mass balance. The thickness and the texture of the corresponding silt laminations are related to the environmental conditions, sediment that is remobilized in the fluvial system during high discharge events.","c("" It is followed by an abrupt increase in particle size, which grades to the coarsest sediment found in each trap"", "" In addition to the spring traps and camera, snow sensors and meteorological data associate the abrupt increase in particle size with the loss of the snow pack during the spring melt"")",,

Drift is continuously being reworked by meltwater as the area between the glacier and the LIAM moraine is both a sediment sink and source. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and particle size distribution analyses (PSD) help us to understand the current state of the ice-marginal and proglacial area. Samples were collected during the late 2012 melt season from 18 locations along supraglacial and two ice-marginal meltwater channels. These icemarginal channels converge 150 m downvalley of the glacial terminus forming the proglacial meltwater-dominated stream, Linnéelva. SSC and discharge of Linnéelva were measured from July 24 to August 8 at two proglacial locations, 0.23 and 1.22 km downvalley of the glacial terminus. Data from the ice-marginal and proglacial study locations provide clues about where meltwater is transporting sediment from the glacier or reworking ice-marginal deposits, and a broad idea of how Linnéelva is reworking sediments in the proglacial area upvalley of the LIAM moraine. Linnébreen, like many other small polythermal and cold-based glaciers in Spitsbergen, does not have moulins or many crevasses that permit meltwater flow to the glacier base; therefore, supraglacial, ice-marginal, and sub-marginal channels play a significant role in the fluvial transport of drift. Sampling of these channels took place in the late melt season when diurnal solar radiation cycles dictated discharge. On August 4 discharge of the east and west ice-marginal channels totaled 0.3 m3/s, SSC of 16 supraglacial and ice-marginal sample sites ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 g/L and averaged vii 0.12 g/L, and particle size at the same sample sites ranged from 1.01 to 22.09 &#956;m and averaged 8.73 &#956;m (silt). The relationships between SSC, PSD, and channel characteristics reveal ice-marginal channels to be complicated sources and sinks for glaciofluvial sediment. In many places there is a direct correlation between change in slope, SSC, and PSD. Also, samples from a supraglacial channel suggested meltwater dilution based on a decrease in SSC but no significant change in PSD. SSC and PSD suggest that the eastern ice-marginal channel was acting as a sediment sink during the late melt season. At the two proglacial sampling locations on Linnéelva discharge from July 24 to August 8 averaged 0.77 m3/s with the upper site SSC averaging 0.135 g/L, and the lower site SSC averaging 0.212 g/L. From late July to early August approximately 6.6 x 104 kg more sediment in suspension passed through the lower site than the upper site, suggesting Linnéelva is significantly eroding its banks in-between the two sample sites. However, data from the 2010 field season indicates net deposition in this same area. This shift from deposition to erosion can most likely be explained by Linnéelva downcutting through the LIAM moraine-dammed lake deposits before flowing past the lower sampling site. As Linnébreen retreats ice-marginal channels develop in areas of newly exposed basal drift, however the bulk of those sediments are most likely eroded during the high discharge events earlier in the melt season, such as the spring freshet. Data from the late melt season suggest that the bulk of material transported in suspension via the icemarginal channels originates from supraglacial and englacial debris higher on the glacial surface. These larger particles sizes are then deposited in meltwater channels downvalley as the slope and water velocity decrease. Further downvalley the SSC data from July 24 to August 8 reveal a significant amount of erosion, possibly from downcutting into lacustrine deposits. The spatial and temporal inconsistencies of stream behavior between the ice-marginal and proglacial regions within the LIAM moraine, and between the 2012 and 2010 field seasons represent difficulties in correlating environmental variation with the proglacial sediment record along Linnéelva and the glaciolacustrine record downvalley in Linnévatnet.","c("" Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and particle size distribution analyses (PSD) help us to understand the current state of the ice-marginal and proglacial area"", ""12 g/L, and particle size at the same sample sites ranged from 1"", "" These larger particles sizes are then deposited in meltwater channels downvalley as the slope and water velocity decrease"")",,

These sediments are directly related to glacial processes and reflect the conditions under which they formed. Such conditions are sensitive to global climate change, which is amplified in northern latitudes, creating a unique environment for climate change research. Quantitative provenance studies have never been carried out in the Kongsfjorden before, and can provide data for a better understanding of glacial processes and dynamics, and changes in erosional conditions. Particularly, sedimentation rates and sediment grain size distribution can help unravel the glacial history of the area. This study will focus on analyzing the grain size distribution of the material being deposited by the mentioned glaciers and finding the source rock of these sediments. Fine sediment was transported by streams and upflows identified in the field, and fed by the glaciers melting ice. On the other hand, coarser material ranging from cobble to boulder size was deposited by ice, moraines, and alluvial processes. Sediment and rock samples were collected during the months of July and August 2009, along the terminus of the glacier, and in the surrounding areas, respectively. Grain size analysis was performed on the samples using a Malvern Mastersizer with the resulting in different groups showing a change in particle size and sorting depending on the location along the glacier. This analysis is important as mineral composition and transportation is influenced by grain size. Electron microprobe studies were carried out on sediment grains to obtain a rough compositional profile of the sediments, and a first-order mineralogical make-up. The microprobe results provided us with information about composition of some of the minerals present, based on the content of Fe, Ca, K and Al derived from the erosion of the local lithologies. Chemical composition can distinguish sediments derived from different sources, and may ultimately be compared with representative rock samples taken from the moraines. Due to the limited accessibility to some areas, many geological units in the Kongsfjorden area have not been mapped or studied, limiting the possible comparisons with contributing material to the fjord’s seafloor.

Although the basic statistics agree with what has been published in various climatologies, the seasonal correlation length scales between the observations are shorter than the annual correlation length scales, especially during summer when the inhomogeneity between the ice-covered ocean and the land is most apparent. During autumn, winter, and spring, the monthly mean correlation length scales are approximately constant at about 1000 km; during summer, the length scales are much shorter, i.e. as low as 300 km. These revised scales are particularly important in the optimal interpolation of data on surface air temperature (SAT) and are used in the analysis of an improved SAT dataset called IABP/POLES. Compared to observations from land stations and the Russian North Pole drift stations, the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) / Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface (POLES) dataset has higher correlations and lower rms errors than previous SAT fields and provides better temperature estimates, especially during summer in the marginal ice zones. In addition, the revised correlation length scales allow data taken at interior land stations to be included in the optimal interpretation analysis without introducing land biases to grid points over the ocean. The new analysis provides 12-hour fields of air temperatures on a 100-km rectangular grid for all land and ocean areas of the Arctic region for the years 1979-2004."," Although the basic statistics agree with what has been published in various climatologies, the seasonal correlation length scales between the observations are shorter than the annual correlation length scales, especially during summer when the inhomogeneity between the ice-covered ocean and the land is most apparent",,

This workshop also presented integrated tools for helping scientists, funded by the NSF and working in the Arctic, better connect with rural communities. There is clearly a need to provide training as demonstrated by the 43 applications received for 8 spots. The workshop was led by a high-profile panel that included: Lisa Busch (Executive Director of the SSSC); Elizabeth Arnold, (a  science communication expert, University of Alaska journalism professor and former National Public Radio Senior correspondent); Angela Gonzalez (from the Rural Alaska Community Action Program, Inc., an Alaska Native with expertise in rural living); Richard Nelson (a cultural anthropologist and radio producer); Jackie Grebmeier and Lee Cooper, (University of Maryland research scientists with 40 years of experience working in the Arctic). The workshop was held in the Fall of 2016 at the SSSC which has a legacy of scientific training in Alaska and professional, nationally-recognized expertise in science communication. The Sitka workshop setting benefitted from the proximity of Mt. Edgecumbe High School, a state-operated boarding school, which has historically provided secondary education to students from over 90 Alaska Native villages across Alaska. The workshop prepared scientists to use rural community resources to hire a local resident to work on their scientific project. Over the course of three days, scientists received lectures and hands on practice activities and visited a variety of community locations typical of rural Alaska, including the tribal government offices, the public radio station, and a community center where they dined with local residents and talked about their research in a casual setting. Participants also learned some best practices for visiting school classrooms and they observed a Scientists in the Schools lesson within the Sitka Native Education Program. Workshop participants prepared a five-minute talk, without a PowerPoint, and presented it to Mt. Edgecumbe High School students who had pre-lessons in science communication in advance of the workshop. Students then evaluated the participants by filling out feedback forms that tested what the students had learned from the talks. Scientists learned about understanding their audience, replacing technical language with common words, and storytelling. They received training in working with the media, and learned the importance and relevance of tribal governance to scientific work. In person feedback was given at the end of the workshop and then participants filled out an in-depth, online survey.

Studies of the population ecology of these birds included nest-monitoring to determine timing of reproduction and reproductive success; live capture of birds to collect blood samples, feathers, and fecal samples for investigations of population structure and pathogens; banding of birds to determine annual survival rates; resighting of color-banded birds to determine space use and site fidelity; and use of light-sensitive geolocators to investigate migratory movements. Data on climatic conditions, prey abundance, and predators were also collected. Environmental data included weather stations that recorded daily climatic conditions, surveys of seasonal snowmelt, weekly sampling of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates that are prey of shorebirds, live trapping of small mammals (alternate prey for shorebird predators), and daily counts of potential predators (jaegers, falcons, foxes).

However, observed changes have yet to be linked to below ground processes of past ecosystem productivity and specifically how natural variations in moisture and temperature during the Holocene influenced microbial processing of soil organic matter. This project is to explore the relationship between chemical composition and bioavailability of Arctic soil carbon accumulated since the early Holocene. The project will result in a potentially transformative parameterization of the drivers of Arctic soil carbon usage that may be applicable globally. This research is directly related to understanding processes affecting Arctic soil carbon and will support an early career researcher. This study will provide training opportunities for a graduate student (Ph.D. student in Earth Sciences at the University of South Carolina) and several undergraduate students, who will be trained through existing summer research programs (NSF funded REU in Marine Biogeochemistry at USC). Strategies for outreach and information dissemination include: 1) recruitment of minority undergraduate to participate in summer research and present their findings, 2) inclusion of the Holocene climate data in upper level undergraduate and graduate courses, 3) creation of a project website to highlight the main findings of the project, 4) working with journalists to share the research on an internationally distributed Podcast, and 5) communicating the findings with other scientists through publishing in top-tier journals and through presentations at national or international meetings. Capitalizing on the premise that microbial cell membranes adopt the radiocarbon signature of their food sources, this work will fingerprint in situ carbon usage as a function of soil chemical polarity, contemporary moisture conditions and Holocene climate variability in a range of soils from the Arctic Circle to the Canadian high Arctic. The working hypothesis is that soil carbon bioavailability is strongly influenced by the chemical polarity of organic matter. It is expected that moist conditions favor both the production of more chemically polar compounds and increased microbial reworking of organic matter, such that variations in Arctic Holocene moisture are coupled to soil carbon bioavailability. Establishing a relationship between the soil chemistry and bioavailability will enable more accurate representation of soil carbon in Earth System models, which is especially critical in the Arctic."," Strategies for outreach and information dissemination include: 1) recruitment of minority undergraduate to participate in summer research and present their findings, 2) inclusion of the Holocene climate data in upper level undergraduate and graduate courses, 3) creation of a project website to highlight the main findings of the project, 4) working with journalists to share the research on an internationally distributed Podcast, and 5) communicating the findings with other scientists through publishing in top-tier journals and through presentations at national or international meetings",,

These objectives will be accomplished using a unique, NSF-funded analytical system developed specifically for such measurements in ice cores and recently expanded to include detailed measurements of black carbon (BC; soot) and a range of new aerosol source tracers. Proposed measurements of aerosols during the past 2000 years - building on a series of recently published findings from similar measurements in shallower ice cores - will be made on samples from a 400 m shallow core collected by Danish collaborators in 2008 and 2009 at the NorthEem (NEEM) drilling site in northern Greenland. To place the NEEM measurements in larger Arctic and global perspective, samples from a broad array of ~1000 year archived Arctic ice cores also will be analyzed and results from the Arctic measurements compared with similar century to millennial scale aerosol measurements already underway in Antarctic ice cores. Intellectual Merit: Natural changes in the Earth's climate are well documented in paleoclimate records, but the climate history provided by deep ice cores needs to be complemented by better understanding of how recent climate changes have affected different regions and relationships among high-, mid-, and lowlatitude processes. Short-lived aerosols - including those generated by wildfires - are important environmental and global climate forcing agents and, because of the snow-albedo feedback, particularly important to Arctic forcing when deposited in snow and ice. Their sources are primarily in the low- and mid-latitudes, but their impacts on the Polar Regions - poorly quantified because of the paucity of reliable, long-term measurements - are profound. The rich glaciochemical records developed from the NEEM and archived ice cores, especially when compared to similar Antarctic ice core aerosol records and the results synthesized through collaborative modeling studies, will transform global understanding of the sources and histories of short-lived BC, dust, volcanic, sea salt, and pollution aerosols and their impacts on climate forcing, ecosystems, and human health. Moreover, because wildfire emissions are one factor directly modulating GHG concentrations, the independent history of fire emissions provided by this and related Antarctic research will contribute to a quantitative interpretation of changing GHG concentrations measured in the deep NEEM and WAIS Divide ice cores. Broader Impacts: Policy decisions are guided by global climate model (GCM) predictions of climate under different scenarios of societal behavior; climate predictions are critically dependent on well-tuned, validated models. Despite large uncertainties in aerosol forcing identified by the IPCC, ice core aerosol records seldom are used in GCM calibration, parameterization, or tuning because of the limited scope and reliability of past ice core aerosol measurements. New generation aerosol measurements from this ice core analytical system are suitable and have enabled recent collaborations with the GCM community. To ensure the broadest impact of the proposed research in climate change and policy arenas (e.g., recent testimony before the U.S. Congress on short-lived pollutants and Arctic climate change), ongoing collaborations with modelers at NCAR, NOAA/GFDL and NASA/GISS will be expanded to incorporate the proposed ice core measurements into GCM studies. This proposal also directly addresses a thrust of the NSF-sponsored International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS) initiative - development of an array of detailed ice core records spanning the last 2000 years aimed at better understanding long-term climate records thorough improved, quantitative investigation of recent climate change and the role of human activities in climate forcing and on the environment. The NEEM project provides many national and international opportunities for education and outreach. The proposed effort will leverage these opportunities to the fullest extent and continue the long-term record of high school, undergraduate and graduate student, and post-doctoral fellow involvement in the laboratory; K-12 educational efforts; and dissemination of results through high visibility publications and outreach to the public, popular media, and policy makers.","c("" Proposed measurements of aerosols during the past 2000 years - building on a series of recently published findings from similar measurements in shallower ice cores - will be made on samples from a 400 m shallow core collected by Danish collaborators in 2008 and 2009 at the NorthEem (NEEM) drilling site in northern Greenland"", "" The proposed effort will leverage these opportunities to the fullest extent and continue the long-term record of high school, undergraduate and graduate student, and post-doctoral fellow involvement in the laboratory; K-12 educational efforts; and dissemination of results through high visibility publications and outreach to the public, popular media, and policy makers""

Funds are provided to collect baseline winter information on the overwintering physical and biological characteristics of three important Arctic Seas: The Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. Understanding of seasonality, and particularly winter conditions, in the Arctic is severely limited because of difficulties in accessing these regions during winter and because of limitations to sensor technology that can be deployed on overwintering moorings and ice-tethered profilers/buoys. In particular, understanding of the overwintering strategies of one of the dominant copepod genera, Calanus spp., is not well understood but is critical to ecosystem modeling efforts. This lack of knowledge has compromised our ability to model and to predict Arctic ecosystems, knowledge that is critical to our efforts to understand the potential impacts of ongoing climate change. A 6-week cruise to the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas was conducted during November and December 2011 during which physical (hydrography, circulation), chemical (nutrients), and biological (zooplankton, microzooplankton, chlorophyll) sampling was done to describe the hydrography, circulation and aspects of the planktonic and nutrient environments, identify the overwintering habitat of Calanus spp., determine the condition and activity of Calanus spp. and euphausiids, describe the interconnectedness between species/populations of Calanus and euphausiids in these regions, identify the transformations of Pacific Water on the Chukchi Shelf, describe off-shelf flow of Pacific Water into the Arctic Ocean and the circulation and hydrography of Barrow Canyon, and quantify the course- and fine-scale vertical distributions of plankton and particles in relation to the vertical structure of the water column."," and euphausiids, describe the interconnectedness between species/populations of Calanus and euphausiids in these regions, identify the transformations of Pacific Water on the Chukchi Shelf, describe off-shelf flow of Pacific Water into the Arctic Ocean and the circulation and hydrography of Barrow Canyon, and quantify the course- and fine-scale vertical distributions of plankton and particles in relation to the vertical structure of the water column",,

We present a new method for continuous semi-quantitative measurement of 239Pu in ice cores, which was used to develop annual records of fallout from NWT in ten ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. The 239Pu was measured directly using an Inductively Coupled Plasma - Sector Field Mass Spectrometer, thereby reducing analysis time and increasing depth-resolution with respect to previous methods. To validate this method, we compared our one year averaged results to published 239Pu records and other records of NWT. The 239Pu profiles from four Arctic ice cores reflected global trends in NWT and were in agreement with discrete Pu profiles from lower latitude ice cores. The 239Pu measurements in the Antarctic ice cores tracked low latitude NWT, consistent with previously published discrete records from Antarctica. Advantages of the continuous 239Pu measurement method are (1) reduced sample preparation and analysis time; (2) no requirement for additional ice samples for NWT fallout determinations; (3) measurements are exactly co-registered with all other chemical, elemental, isotopic, and gas measurements from the continuous analytical system; and (4) the long half-life means the 239Pu record is stable through time.","c("" To validate this method, we compared our one year averaged results to published 239Pu records and other records of NWT"", "" The 239Pu measurements in the Antarctic ice cores tracked low latitude NWT, consistent with previously published discrete records from Antarctica"")",,

,,m,,http://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2125Q85R,doi:10.18739/A2125Q85R,"We conducted a survey along the Beaufort margin to investigate the origin of the Younger Dryas cooling that began about 13,000 years ago. For decades this cold event has been associated with sea ice in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, and the storage and release of fresh water from a large glacial lake in North America, yet its origin remains controversial. Radiocarbon dates, isotope data, acoustic character and grain size data have fingerprinted the potential catastrophic flood deposit along the Beaufort margin in the Arctic Ocean. The marine evidence is consistent with the onshore data and provides a much-improved age model for the catastrophic glacial lake draining.  The origin of Younger Dryas (YD) cooling at ~13 ka, after 2 kyr of postglacial warming, is a century-old climate problem. The YD is thought to have resulted from a slow-down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in response to a flood of Laurentide ice sheet meltwater from glacial Lake Agassiz in Canada. Although there is no oxygen isotopic (d18O) evidence in the western North Atlantic for a local source of meltwater where it was predicted, we report here that the eastern Beaufort Sea contains the long-sought d18O minimum at ~12.9 ka, suggesting that Lake Agassiz meltwater flowed down the Mackenzie River and into the Arctic Ocean. This fresh water would have traveled north along the Canadian Archipelago, and through Fram Strait to the Nordic Seas where surface freshening and freezing near sites of deep water formation would have suppressed convection and caused the YD by reducing the AMOC.  During the Younger Dryas dramatic changes to regional climates occurred. Models of oceanographic circulation predict that freshwater from the glacier lakes made their way from the Arctic to the north Atlantic Ocean. There it disrupted a circulation pattern that stretches from Greenland to the Southern Ocean. In normal mode, the AMOC transports warm equatorial waters poleward and releases heat to the atmosphere. Such a disruption caused substantial cooling in Europe, The Younger Dryas in fact takes its name from a flower (Dryas octopetala) that flourished in the continent’s cold conditions at the time. The Younger Dryas cooling lasted only a short time in an overall warming period that lasted 20,000 years, but it’s an important example of how feedbacks affect the climate system. Overall trends of warming or cooling on Earth are not linear but are punctuated by reversals and accelerations such as this one. Such events help scientists interpret current trends, distinguishing global climate signals from regional signals.  The findings from this study will stimulate more research on how much fresh water is really necessary to cause a change in the system and weakening of the AMOC. It certainly calls further attention to the warming we're observing in the Arctic today, and the accelerated melting of Greenland ice. Earlier in 2018, a paper published by researchers at the University College London and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found evidence that the AMOC hasn’t been running at peak strength since the mid-1800s and is currently at its weakest point in the past 1,600 years. Continued weakening could disrupt weather patterns from the U.S. and Europe to the African Sahel.

Unfortunately, satellite observations of sea ice only extend back to 1979, and direct observations before then are spotty at best. Recently, there have been several advances in sea ice proxies. Specifically improvements in diatom-based proxies and the molecular biomarker, IP25, have allowed quantitative reconstructions of Arctic sea ice. Today, the Bering Sea is seasonally covered in sea ice, and diatoms dominate primary productivity there. This makes it an ideal location for a diatom-based sea ice proxy.

One likely impact of climatic change will be a decoupling of biological interactions among organisms at different trophic levels, leading to a 'phenological mismatch' in the seasonal timing of life-history events for plants, insects, birds and higher-level predators. Arctic breeding shorebirds are expected to be 'integrative sentinels' for the effects of global climate change because high energetic requirements, long-distance migratory movements, and synchronized timing of seasonal activities increase their vulnerability to changing environments. This project will examine the effects of environmental conditions in the Arctic on the ecology and trophic relationships of two species of migratory shorebirds: Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) and Western Sandpipers (C. mauri). One challenge for assessing the ecological consequences of climate change is a lack of baseline data for most organisms. A unique feature of this project is that the researcher collected detailed data on the seasonal timing, demography and movements of sandpipers in a 4-year period (1993-1996) at an undisturbed 4 square km coastal tundra study site near Nome, Alaska. In this 3-year field project (2011-2013) the research team will monitor shorebird populations and four key environmental factors: climatic conditions, arthropod emergence, abundance of small mammals and predators. They will also deploy geolocator tags to determine migration routes and nonbreeding sites for the study populations. Data on shorebird ecology will be collected using standardized field protocols at the same site, under the direction of the lead investigator who collected the original data, and will span a 15-20 year interval of environmental change. The broader context of our research will be the comprehensive knowledge of the annual cycle of migratory sandpipers that has been developed under the 16-year research program of the 'Western Sandpiper Research Network'. This is one of the first field studies to test predictions of the 'phenological mismatch' hypothesis for arctic-breeding shorebirds and to examine long-term changes in trophic interactions among food resources, migratory sandpipers, and their predators. The hypothesis will be rejected if long-term changes are lacking but standardized sampling will provide a framework for future studies of ecological resilience. The hypothesis will be supported if warming climatic conditions have changed the timing of insect emergence without changes in phenology of shorebird nesting, potentially leading to declines in densities of nesting birds. Strong inferences about the effects of arctic conditions can be made because the study species breed sympatrically but have different migration routes and nonbreeding areas. This project will provide insights for conservation of migratory birds that breed at high latitudes in the Arctic. Traditional methods for surveying arctic birds are based on nest monitoring and this project will evaluate the extent to which more intensive demographic approaches are a useful alternative. The project will offer training opportunities for one PhD student and up to six undergraduate students.

Three to five lead experts for each system refined survey questions and developed a system summary document providing relevant literature and background information. System summaries included regional and pan-arctic estimates of C pools and fluxes, a brief treatment of historical trends, and a summary of model projections where available. We identified potential participants by querying Thomas Reuters Web of Science with applicable search terms (e.g. arctic, boreal, biomass, dissolved organic carbon, fire, permafrost). To reach researchers with applicable expertise who were underrepresented in the literature, we supplemented the list with personal referrals from lead experts and all participants. In total 256 experts were invited to participate. We distributed the surveys and system summaries via email with a two-week deadline. After sending out three reminders and accepting responses for three months after initial invitation, we received 115 responses from 98 experts (38% response rate), with 15 experts participating in more than one survey (Supplementary information; list of experts). Experts provided quantitative estimates of change in biomass, hydrologic flux, or wildfire for three time points (2040, 2100, and 2300) and four regional warming scenarios based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Warming scenarios ranged from cessation of human emissions before 2100 (RCP2.6) to sustained human emissions (RCP8.5) and correspond to permafrost-region mean annual warming of 2 to 7.5°C by 2100. The regional warming scenarios were generated from RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model 4. Experts were encouraged to consider all available information when generating their estimates including published and unpublished modeled and empirical data as well as professional judgment. Participants self-rated their confidence and expertise for each question, described rationale for their estimates, and provided background information. For the purposes of this survey, warming was assumed to stabilize at 2100 levels for all scenarios so that responses through 2300 accounted for lags in ecosystem responses to climate drivers. While we only provided temperature scenarios with the surveys, we asked experts to consider all accompanying direct climate effects (e.g. temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2) and indirect effects (e.g. vegetation shifts, permafrost degradation, invasive species, and disturbance). The biomass survey consisted of a single question asking for cumulative change in tundra and boreal non-soil biomass including above and belowground living biomass, standing deadwood, and litter. The wildfire survey asked for estimates of change in wildfire extent and CO2 emissions for the boreal and tundra regions to assess changes in both fire extent and severity. The hydrologic flux survey asked for estimates of DOC and POC delivery to freshwater ecosystems in the pan-arctic watershed and delivery to the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas via riverine flux and coastal erosion, allowing the calculation of losses during transport due to burial or mineralization. Dissolved inorganic C fluxes were not included in this survey. Questions from the three surveys: Arctic and boreal biomass Question 1. How much change in boreal forest and arctic tundra non-soil biomass would result from the following increases in pan-arctic mean annual surface air temperature? (Positive numbers represent % increase, negative represent % decrease). Note: This question addresses changes in non-soil biomass for the circumpolar tundra and boreal forest due to direct climate forcing (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO2, seasonality etc.) as well as indirect effects (changes in primary productivity, vegetation shifts, nutrient availability, insects, pathogens, wildfire, etc.). The table below provides estimates of current biome area and biomass. While the tundra and boreal biomes may shift over time, we are asking you to estimate biomass change for the current distribution of these biomes. For example, if biomass increased for a patch of land which currently is tundra but which becomes boreal forest, that increment would be included in your % change in biomass of arctic tundra. Arctic and boreal wildfire Question 1. How much change in the annual extent of boreal and arctic wildland fire would result from the following increases in the mean annual surface air temperature in the pan-arctic? (Positive numbers represent % increase, negative represent % decrease). Note: This question addresses changes in wildfire extent in the circumpolar boreal forest and tundra due to direct climate effects (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO2, seasonality etc.) as well as indirect effects (vegetation shifts, insects, pathogens etc.). Question 2. How much change in CO2 release due to boreal and arctic wildland fire would result from the following increases in the mean annual surface air temperature in the pan-arctic? Note: This question addresses changes in carbon emissions due directly to boreal and arctic wildfire. It excludes indirect carbon release due to changes in permafrost extent, net ecosystem production, biome shift, etc. Refer to Question 1 table for estimates of current emissions from wildfire. Circumarctic hydrologic organic carbon flux Question 1. How much change in the amount of organic carbon delivered to freshwater ecosystems in the pan-Arctic watershed would result from the following increases in the mean annual surface air temperature in the pan-arctic? (Positive numbers represent % increase, negative represent % decrease). Note: Questions 1 and 2 address changes in dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) flux in the pan-Arctic watershed (20.5 x 106 km2 (Holmes et al. 2012)) due to direct climate perturbation (temperature, precipitation, etc.) as well as indirect disturbance (permafrost degradation, vegetation shift, etc.). The table below provides estimates of current DOC and POC delivery to freshwater ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and streams) and the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas. Question 2. How much change in the amount of organic carbon delivered to the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas would result from the following increases in the mean annual surface air temperature in the pan-arctic? (Positive numbers represent % increase, negative represent % decrease). Note: This question addresses changes in riverine DOC and POC flux to the ocean as well as changes in POC release from coastal erosion. The difference between the riverine to marine fluxes reported in this question and the terrestrial to freshwater fluxes reported in Question 1 represent the amount of carbon lost in transit due to mineralization and storage in sediment.

Measurements of >35 elemental and chemical components of these aerosols will be made at high depth resolution (>50 measurements per year) in archived ice cores from two lower elevation sites on opposite sides of the Arctic: a 430 m core collected by the University of Copenhagen in 2006 from Flade Isblink ice cap in far northeastern Greenland and a 724 m core collected by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in 1999 to 2001 from Akademii Nauk ice cap in the Russian Arctic.

Many physical processes at a range of time and space scales determine this mass loss, but their relative roles in net loss or gain and trends are poorly understood. This project will investigate the physics of glacier-ocean interaction for a specific system, Petermann Gletscher (PG), using data to improve understanding of processes at the marine margin of PG that drains a large fraction of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) into a deep fjord connected to Nares Strait via a floating, up to 1800 feet thick, ice shelf. The ice shelf has undergone significant retreat in the last few years, from 80 km long in 2010 to 50 km today. Observations of warming of the deep water in Nares Strait and Petermann Fjord, and of ice-shelf thinning during the decade preceding retreat, lead to a hypothesis that increased basal melting contributes to loss of the ice shelf. The project is motivated by three aspects of the Petermann Gletscher and Fjord system: (1) its importance as a gateway for GIS mass loss; (2) comparison of ocean dynamics in Petermann Fjord with previously studied southern Greenland systems; and (3) the value of PG as a well-constrained system for studying processes that contribute to mass loss from other northern Greenland and Antarctic ice-shelf systems and their contribution to rising global sea level. The project takes advantage of recent observations of this system, including ongoing satellite-relayed data from sub-ice-shelf moorings.  This project would contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce through support for the training of two graduate and three undergraduate students, including a student from an under-represented group in STEM fields. The PI would continue his international collaborations with Swedish, English, and Canadian collaborators that were developed as part of the initial Petermann Gletscher study aboard I/B Oden in 2015. Outreach to the general public would be facilitated through the PI?s website, blog, occasional media interviews, and embedding national print journalists in the field work.  Time series analyses will characterize how sub-glacial waters change along the central melt channel with the tides and seasons. Description of the average state and interpretation of variations will be aided by ocean survey data properties collected in the adjacent ocean by ship between 2003 and 2015. Both time- and frequency-domain statistical analyses will reveal correlation time and space scales. More specifically, Fourier, wavelet, and Hilbert transforms will be used to provide estimates of amplitude and phase at discrete scales. Frequency-domain linear system analyses will reveal input-output relations between multiple time series that represent forcings (e.g., atmospheric temperature and wind stress when sea-ice is mobile or absent, tides) and responses (e.g., depth of surface mixed layer, heat content of the meltwater plume, ice velocity and basal melt rate). Analyses of data from GPS and pressure sensors at each mooring will determine the degree of floatation at each site as the glacier transitions from >365 m to <100 m in thickness. Summer ocean surveys describe the inflowing Atlantic waters that will become diluted by basal melt and by direct injection of freshwater. Thermodynamic constraints on the solid-to-fluid phase transition of glacier ice melted by the ocean result in a characteristic relation of ocean temperatures and salinity (the Gade-line), which is set by the latent heat of melting. A second mixing line arises from ice-shelf surface melting and direct runoff into the fjord. In some fjord systems, this component includes a substantial discharge of subglacial water generated upstream of the grounding line. The proposed temperature-salinity analyses will reveal the importance of this sub-glacial freshwater source along the central melt-channel.","s website, blog, occasional media interviews, and embedding national print journalists in the field work",,

CTD/OBS and meteorological data were also collected to characterize this dynamic Arctic system.

A lack of coherent high vertical and temporal resolution observations of cloud particles, aerosols moisture advection (i.e. water vapor) and thermodynamics, creates large uncertainties in current model estimates of cloud properties and inhibits our understanding of cloud radiative and precipitation impacts on the surface. As a result, current weather and climate models poorly parameterize clouds over the Arctic and more specifically over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). A reduction in this uncertainty is particularly important above the GIS, where clouds act as sinks and sources to the ice mass balance by modulating the surface radiation budget and available precipitable water. To gain the understanding necessary to reduce this uncertainty, a new autonomous multi-wavelength, polarized Raman lidar is proposed for development and deployment at the NSFʼs observatory in Summit, Greenland. The new lidar observations will employ multiple wavelengths and polarizations to observe elastic and inelastic scattering from the Arctic atmosphere enabling regular retrieval of temperature, water vapor and extinction profiles.

The hypothesis is that climate controls carbon storage in peatlands through shifts in temperature and moisture related processes of production and decomposition. Use of an existing set of peatland cores from two arctic regions from the late-glacial to the Holocene offers a variety of climate scenarios to examine carbon sequestration. For example, the group hypothesizes that warm, dry intervals result in peatland carbon storage decline, while cool, wet climates result in increased carbon sequestration. Using new tools, including compound-specific isotope and biomarker analysis, and existing traditional paleoclimate proxies such as pollen, macrofossils, and bryophytes, the researchers will produce detailed climate and hydrological reconstructions, and high resolution AMS-14C dating, C and bulk density measurements will provide carbon accumulation rates from the late-glacial to the present and enable the team to test their carbon sequestration-climate hypotheses using a newly-developed mechanistic peatland accumulation model. As high latitudes warm and arctic and subarctic peatlands provide positive and negative carbon feedbacks to the climate system, it is important to add the paleo-perspective to our understanding of magnitude and temporal and spatial scales. This research will couple detailed analysis of changes in paleoecology/paleoclimate (through bryophyte, compound-specific isotope analysis, pollen, and macrofossil analysis) in high latitude peatlands over the last glacial-interglacial cycle with quantification of carbon sequestration in different environments (i.e., wet vs. drier muskegs). These paleo-peatland histories will provide long-term carbon sequestration records, which can be used for comparisons with paleoclimate reconstructions from the same sediments, as well as ice cores, marine records, and lake stratigraphy. The independent paleoclimate data will be utilized by the new Holocene Peatland Model to simulate coupled carbon and water dynamics of northern peatlands at an annual time step over time scales of decades to millennia. The model-simulated carbon accumulation record can be then compared with the peatland histories, and differences evaluated in terms of plant composition, productivity, and decomposition. This iterative model-data research will provide long-term empirical information necessary to evaluate the role of the hydrological cycle in future wetland carbon cycling, and the past importance of climate and vegetation in sequestering carbon over millennia. The selected sites for new sampling include peatlands of Alaska?s North Slope at Toolik Lake where an extensive ecological database exists as well as the arctic foothills of the western Mesa site. AMS 14C ages, as well as Pb-210 and Cs-137, will be used in conjunction with C and bulk density to determine carbon accumulation for each site. Analysis of bryophyte and isotopes/biomarkers will provide defined moisture regimes as well as possible water chemistry changes due to volcanic ash deposition in these sites. Of particular interest are climatic intervals such as the Bolling-Allerod/Younger Dryas, the early Holocene, the Preboreal and 8200-yr events, mid-Holocene, the Neoglacial, Little Ice Age, and the last 50 years.

,,m,,http://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2CZ9N,doi:10.18739/A2CZ9N,"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is present in large amounts in frozen soils and marine sediments in the Arctic. In marine sediments, methane may be present either in permafrost or in gas hydrates. Warming of the Arctic may lead to the release of stored methane, leading to further warming and then to further methane releases in a reinforcing cycle. The East Siberian Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, is a large area with a great deal of undersea permafrost and, likely, stored methane. Recent work has suggested large sources of methane from parts of the East Siberian Sea, but the area needs to be mapped and studied in much greater detail before either the amount of methane stored there or the amount being released can be fully understood. In the summer of 2014, an international program called the Swedish-Russian-US Arctic Ocean Investigation of Climate-Cryosphere-Carbon Interactions (SWERUS-C3) will undertake a 90-day expedition to map, and study the carbon cycle in, the East Siberian Sea. The principal investigators of this proposal are leaders in ocean mapping and they have recently pioneered techniques for acoustic imaging of methane plumes released from the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. They have been invited by the leaders of the SWERUS-C3 team to participate in one leg of the expedition. They propose to use the multibeam sonar on board the ODEN to locate and characterize gas seeps in the water column and then apply a newly developed wideband transceiver to the split-beam echosounder on board the ODEN to constrain the size and fate of gas bubbles rising to the surface. Together, these acoustic observations will help the SWERUS-C3 team understand the flux of methane from the seafloor into the water column and potentially into the atmosphere. If successful, these techniques will allow the mapping of the gas flux in the Arctic over scales never before possible. This proposal requests support for the participation of the UNH team on this expedition and for post-cruise work-up of the data. The project will support a full time graduate student at UNH. A UNH undergraduate student will participate as well. The SWERUS-C3 program as a whole will support over 15 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and has a broad suite of outreach activities planned. The UNH Center for Coastal Ocean Mapping will also incorporate this work into ongoing outreach and education activities.

The site contains the oldest and best preserved collection of faunal remains from the American Arctic, and an assemblage of stone tools that includes fluted projectile points. Fluted projectile points are a type of stone weapon tip associated with the initial phase of human settlement in most regions of the New World. They have not, however, been reliably dated in eastern Beringia (Alaska and unglaciated portions of Yukon), a region of critical importance for thinking about the colonization of the Americas since it was a presumed waypoint for the initial settlers of North and South America as they expanded from their Asian homeland. In the absence of secure dating Beringian fluted points have yet to be situated in a historical or ecological context, and there is little known about the behavior of the people who used this technology or their relationship to fluted point users in the midcontinent. This project will address these issues through interdisciplinary studies at Raven Bluff and analyses of existing fluted point assemblages found in museum collections. At Raven Bluff a research team will: establish a chronological and stratigraphic framework for the archaeological deposits; reconstruct the late Pleistocene and early Holocene environmental setting; describe strategies of faunal exploitation and resource use; and characterize the stone tool production and maintenance activities conducted at the site, including methods of fluted point manufacture and repair. Building on insights from our detailed studies at Raven Bluff we also plan to reexamine existing fluted point assemblages from Alaska, as well as published data from selected fluted point assemblages from the midcontinent, in order to evaluate hypotheses about the transmission and development of fluted point technology within Beringia, and its transmission between Beringia and the midcontinent. Insights resulting from this work will help resolve longstanding questions about the timing of the fluted point occupation in Beringia, and the subsistence and technological adaptations of the people who made fluted point in an extreme, high latitude environment. It will also fill a major geographic and temporal gap in our knowledge of Paleoindian dispersals throughout the Americas. These issues are important because they are connected to the general process of first entry and adaptive radiation of people in all parts of the world, and shed light on the means by which small scale societies adapt to diverse environmental challenges. The broader impacts of this study include training and mentoring of high school, undergraduate and graduate students. Education and outreach efforts through the PolarTREC program will bring an issue of great public interest and scientific importance?the earliest period of cultural development in the New World ?into classrooms across the country."," Building on insights from our detailed studies at Raven Bluff we also plan to reexamine existing fluted point assemblages from Alaska, as well as published data from selected fluted point assemblages from the midcontinent, in order to evaluate hypotheses about the transmission and development of fluted point technology within Beringia, and its transmission between Beringia and the midcontinent",,

Central Asia is highly dependent on glacier meltwater for its water resources. Its high mountains hold great volumes of glacial ice, with seasonal snow melt supplying up to 80% of the region's fresh water needs. However, since the 1960s, central Asia has lost over 14% of its glacier covered area and ~18% of its ice volume. Changes in glacially-fed hydrologic systems impact water availability and biodiversity in these regions. However, these observations cover only a fraction of the climate history of this region. Ice cores from glaciers in the high Himalayas preserve records of millennia of climate changes. Understanding the natural variability recorded in such records is of critical importance for interpreting the vulnerability of the region to modern and future climate change.  Most existing well-dated ice core records from Central Asia (Fedchenko Glacier (Aizen, et al., 2009), It-Tish Ice Cap (Thompson, et al., 1997), Grigorieva Ice Cap (Thompson, et al., 1997; Fujita, et al., 2011) and Inilchek Glacier (Aizen, et al., 2006)) are relatively short, covering the last ~100 years at most. A 100-year-long record includes only that portion of the climate history in Central Asia that is already contained in weather station records (GHCN, 2019). Collecting a long-term ice core record is a necessary step in assessing the natural variability of atmospheric circulation, temperature, and moisture delivery in the region. Our core site in the high Pamir Mountains was selected with the goal of collecting an older record than exists at present from Central Asia with a sampling resolution that would allow annual or sub-annual pattern recognition.  This project recovered a surface-to-bedrock ice core from the Pamir Mountains, in Tajikistan, Central Asia in 2016. The data recovered from it will be used to develop detailed records of climate changes in central Asia during the Holocene. The results will be used to reconstruct the dynamics and rates of moderate, abrupt, and threshold changes in climate in Central Asia. Specifically, the research team has generated sub-annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice core (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles). Ongoing efforts to recover pollen and other biological materials are ongoing.  This data set contains chemical records from the 2016 Pamir ice core. It represents one of the oldest high-resolution ice core chemical records yet recovered from the region, dating to older than 400 C.E. (Current Era). We utilized novel ultrahigh resolution (~500 samples per centimeter of ice core depth) Laser Ablation Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LAICPMS) sampling protocols which allow ice core records to be dated and analyzed where the record is too compressed for traditional methods to resolve.  Discrete sampling of stable water isotopes in the core was done at 0.05meter resolution. Continuous melter sampling for 29 major and trace elements was done at 0.01meter resolution. LAICPMS sampling of selected sections of the core with high-quality ice was done at .00002meter resolution."," Specifically, the research team has generated sub-annually-resolved, multivariate geochemical records from the ice core (including stable isotopes, trace elements, major ions, and dust particles)",,

The project documented and evaluated a range of ongoing efforts to revitalize Itelmen and analyzed the effectiveness of the existing language revitalization tools and programs. This research was conducted in order to contribute to a deeper understanding of language and cultural revitalization programs not only among Itelmens of Kamchatka, but also with the purpose to inform about these programs world-wide. The preservation of this language in the face of centuries of assimilation programs enacted by Russian Imperial and later Soviet administrations is significant. The most significant broader impact is what other Indigenous communities in a similar situation to the Itelmen can learn from this community's struggles and efforts as well as what Itelmens can learn from other communities that are struggling to save their language. 

Researchers on this project aimed to understand which methods should be applied for a successful Itelmen language revitalization program both in class and outside the classroom. When this research started in 2013 there were about nine speakers who were growing up speaking Itelmen as their first language. By the end of the study in 2016 only four speakers remained. 


In Kamchatka the student researcher visited five different locations. Each has its own specifics. 

Part of the research was dedicated to the use of multimedia in language revitalization. The main outcome of this part of the project was the publication of the DVD of Itelmen traditional and contemporary songs with subtitles and video Xaƚc mǝncaⱪa’ƚkicen (Let's sing). The idea was borrowed from the widely known Karaoke. Each song has a voice of the native speaker singing the song, visualized by subtitles in Itelmen and Russian, and video. 

This research indicated that Itelmens are ready to be active in bringing their language back to the active life, however there is a great lack of knowledge about the language immersion methodologies and other techniques that go beyond the educational setting of schools.",The main outcome of this part of the project was the publication of the DVD of Itelmen traditional and contemporary songs with subtitles and video Xaƚc mǝncaⱪa’ƚkicen (Let's sing),,

Sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 genes were used to assess the global phylogeography of this species, and to further elucidate its phylogenetic relationship to other members of the Daphnia pulex species complex. Using both newly acquired and previously published data, we analyzed 398 individuals from collections spanning five continents. Eleven strongly supported lineages were found within the D. pulex complex, and one lineage in particular, panarctic D. pulex, has very little phylogeographical structure and a near worldwide distribution. Mismatch distribution, haplotype network, and population genetic analyses are compatible with a North American origin for this lineage and subsequent spatial expansion in the Late Pleistocene. In addition, our analyses suggest that dispersal between North and South America of this and other species in the D. pulex complex has occurred multiple times, and is predominantly from north to south. Our results provide additional support for the evolutionary relationships of the eleven main mitochondrial lineages of the D. pulex complex. We found that the well-studied panarctic D. pulex is present on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Despite being geographically very widespread, there is a lack of strong regionalism in the mitochondrial genomes of panarctic D. pulex ‐ a pattern that differs from that of most studied cladocerans. Moreover, our analyses suggest recent expansion of the panarctic D. pulex lineage across continents with some continents sharing identical haplotypes. The hypothesis that hybrid asexuality has contributed to the recent and unusual geographic expansion of the panarctic D. pulex lineage warrants further study."," Using both newly acquired and previously published data, we analyzed 398 individuals from collections spanning five continents",,

The main phase of the project will include a three year program of field, laboratory and archival research that will examine the causes, processes and human dimensions of episodic, catastrophic destabilizations of sand environments on northern coasts. The project is also intended to be a case study in the archaeology of disasters, and its findings will contribute to middle range theory on the geoarchaeological signatures of extreme, short-term environmental stresses, and the anthropology of human response to sudden crisis. A key goal of the project is to assess the roles played by massive storm events, or clusters of storms, in mobilizing coastal sands in the Shetland Islands, UK, during periods of climatic variability, and to trace human responses to the succeeding environmental catastrophes. Shetland has been chosen as a geographical focus because it is a region sensitive to storm variability linked with major climate phenomena such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which in turn play dynamic roles in extended sequences of global change. In addition, Shetland has multiple coastal sand environments where landscape and settlement histories may be researched through analyzing rich archaeological, documentary and paleoenvironmental data, and through incorporating traditional ecological knowledge from local residents. In the project's central case study a team of researchers in archaeology, history, geoscience, biology and spatial analysis, drawn from four US and four UK colleges and universities, will collaborate in investigating a medieval township that was buried in eolian sand at Quendale, Dunrossness, in the later 17th century CE, a time of extreme Little Ice Age climate shifts. This ecological and economic disaster will be studied through bioarchaeological and material culture analyses, complemented by an archival records survey of contemporary documents relating to issues of climate, resources and settlement. Ground penetrating radar surveys of the project area, in conjunction with studies of terrestrial and lake sediments, and soils analyses, will facilitate reconstruction of the history of sand movements, land use, and settlement changes. A biological study of oxygen isotope ratios in marine mollusc archaeofaunas will provide an independent proxy measure of local sea temperatures from medieval to pre-modern times, yielding data that will be integrated with larger-scale climate and environmental datasets to assess local expressions of global and hemispheric trends. Advanced GPS, GIS and other digital recording systems will facilitate the collection, organization, analysis and archiving of diverse environmental, archaeological and historical data The project crosses many disciplinary and national boundaries in studying human-environment interactions in a type of catastrophe scenario that apparently evolved on the sub-annual to decadal time scales that may characterize many future environmental challenges that will be faced by northern coast- dwellers as global warming proceeds. Project personnel combine researchers with extensive multi-region experience in northern environments with researchers and educators who are new to boreal research. The broad integration of disciplines and multiregional experience brought by the team will also enrich: a) training and educational experiences for participating undergraduate and graduate students; b) outreach activities with pupils and teachers at two primary schools; and c) collaborative projects with community residents who will be involved in archaeological and oral history research, and who will access project findings in local publications and presentations."," The broad integration of disciplines and multiregional experience brought by the team will also enrich: a) training and educational experiences for participating undergraduate and graduate students; b) outreach activities with pupils and teachers at two primary schools; and c) collaborative projects with community residents who will be involved in archaeological and oral history research, and who will access project findings in local publications and presentations",,

The students undertake important climate change research and experience the challenges and rewards of conducting high latitude research. The primary research goal is to understand how climate influences the modern glacial, fluvial lacustrine, and fjord systems. By studying these modern processes, students will interpret the sediment record as a high-resolution record of late Holocene climate change. The students are integrally involved in defining their research questions and designing specific testable hypotheses throughout the program. They complete their research projects at their home institutions during the following academic year. This project collaborates closely with UNIS, the University Centre onSvalbard, with both UNIS students and faculty working together during the summer field season. Intellectual Merit: The Arctic is an area of active research because it is highly sensitive to climate change and because climatically induced environmental changes in this region can instigate further changes of global consequence. Recently published data indicate that the Arctic is warming much faster than lower latitudes and even greater rates of change and ecosystem disruption are predicted with the continuing decay of the Arctic Ocean pack ice. Svalbard is strongly influenced by the northern end of the warm Gulf Stream current, and therefore its climate is sensitive to changes in global scale oceanic circulation. Svalbard has warmed considerably during the last 90 years and climate proxies indicate even greater Holocene climate variability. Despite this, little is known of sub-century climate change and virtually nothing is known of decadal scale variability in this Arctic region. This project has initiated long term monitoring of the rapidly changing Arctic cryospheric/hydrosphere that will facilitate interpretation of high-resolution proxy records from the Svalbard region. Broader Impacts: This project benefits society by recruiting and training the next generation of Arctic researchers, and our modern process studies will directly improve predictive models of future climate change by strengthening the link between climate processes and climate proxies. We make every effort to recruit students from diverse populations and from institutions lacking in-house research opportunities. The Principal Investigators, undergraduate participants, and participating K-12 teachers make frequent and wide-reaching outreach to public audiences on Arctic climate change issues and the importance of science education, increasing awareness of Arctic environmental change in K-12 classrooms around the world.
