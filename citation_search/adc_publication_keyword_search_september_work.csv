AOTIM5 was created using the OSU Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) package (https://www.tpxo.net/). Model development is described by Padman and Erofeeva (2004) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL019003). The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry (Jakobsson et al., 2000; https://doi.org/10.1029/00EO00059). AOTIM5 consists of grids of sea surface height and depth-integrated currents (“volume transports”) for each of 8 tidal constituents; 4 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2) and 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1). The first step in building AOTIM5 was development of the Arctic Ocean Dynamics-based Tide Model (AODTM5), which is also available at the Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2901ZG3N). That model was forced at open ocean boundaries by the TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic tidal solution version 6.2 (TPXO.6.2), and by local astronomical forcing (“potential tides”). Each constituent in AODTM5 was tuned, separately, to Arctic tide height data by optimizing the linear drag coefficient. AOTIM5 used AODTM5 as a “prior” model, then assimilated coastal and benthic tide gauges, and TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS satellite radar altimetry, to improve the 4 largest-amplitude constituents, M2, S2, K1 and O1.  An updated version of this model created in 2018, Arc5km2018, is also available at the Arctic Data Center. The newer model uses updated open boundary conditions, and a wider range of assimilated data including much longer satellite altimetry records. We recommend that users compare results from AOTIM5 and Arc5km2018 before deciding which to use for a specific application.

Despite this, relatively little is known about the temporal and spatial dynamics of meltwater routing through and retention in/under the GrIS. Thus to investigate if GrIS hydrologic processes stay active year-round, we deployed to southwest Greenland during winter, approximately 4 months after summertime surface melt. We surveyed the frozen Isortoq, Sandflugtdalen, Ørkendalen, and Watson proglacial rivers, which drain all meltwater runoff from tributary Isunguata Sermia, Russell, Leverett, Ørkendalen, and Isorlersuup outlet glaciers. At each river site, we established transects across the river ice perpendicular to summertime flow direction. We then executed ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys along each transect and also mechanically drilled boreholes through the river ice. We discovered evidence of minimal meltwater export beneath proglacial river ice in the Isortoq River. Geochemical analysis of this water suggests that it was sourced from the GrIS. Surveys in neighboring proglacial rivers revealed no evidence of meltwater runoff. We suggest that the discovered runoff only in the Isortoq River is the result of residual meltwater storage and release enabled by a deep, spatially pervasive, subglacial trough beneath Isunguata Sermia outlet glacier. This suggests that GrIS hydrological processes can stay active year-round. The enclosed data supports these results, and includes: point locations of river ice thickness measured in mechanically drilled boreholes; GPR data and processed echograms; approximate point locations of bright reflectors mapped beneath the Isortoq River ice. This data supports the methods, results and conclusions in Pitcher et al. (2020)."," This data supports the methods, results and conclusions in Pitcher et al",

----------------------- Description ----------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These data are gridded maps of Alaska containing historical and 
future downscaled climate data. Specifically, there are maps of 
monthly (1) temperature and (2) total precipitation minus 
potential evapotranspiration (P-PET). Here, in our data files, 
we re-label 'P-PET' as 'DEF' for 'deficit'. For both historical and future
data the months correspond to a ""fire year"", or a year begining on 
October 1st and ending on September 30th. Due to this, data for the 
months of October, November, and December are the values recorded for
previous year. For example, P-PET data for November 2002, is the estimate
of P-PET for November 2001.

30-yr probabiltiy of fire occurrence for three different time periods
in the 21st century: 2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2099. We use
downscaled GCM climate data under the RCP6.0 scenario. We provide
projections for all 100 models for each of the three different spatial
domains: AK, BOREAL, and TUNDRA. Gridded GCM data were processed and 
provided by the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning
(https://www.snap.uaf.edu/). FOr further details regarding these

CO2 and CH4 exchange between the terrestrial ecosystems of the basin and the atmosphere, along with the export of dissolved organic C (DOC) to the Arctic Ocean, were estimated using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The TEM considers the effects of a number of factors on its simulations of C dynamics including changes in atmospheric CO2, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, climate, and disturbance/land use including fire, forest harvest, and agricultural establishment/abandonment. We used the methane dynamics module of TEM (MDM-TEM) to estimate the exchange of CH4 with atmosphere of both wetlands. The MDM-TEM considers the effects of a number of factors on its simulations of CH4 dynamics including the area of wetlands, fluctuations in the water table of wetlands, temperature, and labile carbon inputs into the soil solution derived from the net primary production (NPP) estimates of TEM. The results of these simulations were compared with estimates of CO2 and CH4 exchange from atmospheric inversion models and with observations of terrestrial C export from Arctic watersheds. The simulated transfer of land-based C to the Arctic Ocean was compared against estimates based on a sampling of DOC export from major Arctic rivers (McClelland et al., 2008). We summarize our estimates of surface-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange for the land and ocean area matching the three high-latitude regions defined in the Transcom 3 model experiments (Gurney et al., 2002), namely the Boreal North America, Boreal Asia and Northern Ocean regions.","c("" The simulated transfer of land-based C to the Arctic Ocean was compared against estimates based on a sampling of DOC export from major Arctic rivers (McClelland et al"", "" We summarize our estimates of surface-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange for the land and ocean area matching the three high-latitude regions defined in the Transcom 3 model experiments (Gurney et al"")",

The goal of this initiative involved mooring the Ice Breaker (IB) Oden to an ice floe in the inner pack ice in the high Arctic Ocean, and monitoring key oceanic-atmospheric parameters as the ice drifts. The cruise timeline (August through September) was chosen to highlight the transitional time period from the summer maximum in microbial biomass to declining stocks as autumn conditions result in lower nutrient and light levels, concomitant with the onset of freezing conditions. Biogenic aerosol production and fluxes are key research parameters in understanding the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and their impacts on the radiation budget of the Arctic Ocean. At present, there exists a paucity of data regarding how microbial community composition might change in the high Arctic Ocean, especially with respect to changes in the production of volatile aerosol precursor compounds as pelagic microbial communities replace sympagic communities. Specifically, this project focused on linking microbial community structure with the oceanic-atmosphere fluxes of volatile organic carbon compounds (VOCs) emitted from various oceanic and pack ice ecosystems.  The role of diminishing sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean will significantly impact biogenic aerosol production and fluxes via changes in microbial community structure and the release of VOCs. At present, however, the scarcity of in-situ oceanic VOC measurements available from the high Arctic Ocean prevents the development of robust models correlating phytoplankton biomass with VOCs and their impact on aerosol production. For instance, most current models utilize satellite chlorophyll a (Chla) imagery for estimating phytoplankton biomass (e.g. Gabric et al. 2014; Becagli et al. 2016). It is also well recognized that high concentrations of sea surface chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can significantly bias remotely-sensed Chla concentrations, especially when Chla levels are less than 0.5 mg m 3 (Matsuoka et al. 2017). In addition to the bias in estimating in-situ phytoplankton biomass from satellite-derived Chla, the contribution made by oceanic VOC fluxes to the atmospheric aerosol optical depth (e.g. Gabric et al., 2002) is unknown. Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic mixed layer depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al., 2011). As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al. 2013). Hence, models that use satellites over relatively large areal expanses in the Arctic may be biased with regards to estimates of biomass, net primary production and as a result correlations to biogenic aerosol (Arrigo et al., 2011, Becagli et al., 2016). More importantly, however,
total Chla biomass is not the only important variable affecting the production of oceanic biogenic VOCs and aerosols. The microbial community composition and physiology will not only affect the cell-specific production rate of precursor biogenic aerosol compounds, but also the secondary transformations of those compounds. Furthermore, determining VOCs or phytoplankton functional groups from space are both fraught with even more difficulty than Chla estimates alone. Consequently, at present, virtually no data exists regarding the suite of VOCs released to the high Arctic atmosphere as a function of the in-situ microbial community composition.  This dataset includes nutrient concentrations of samples collected by CTD from August 2 to September 20, 2018. Nutrient availability plays a vital role in influencing the productivity and structure of the microbial community, which in turn impacts the air-sea flux of organic carbon and VOCs.","c("" Gabric et al"", "" 2014; Becagli et al"", ""5 mg m 3 (Matsuoka et al"", "" Gabric et al"", "" Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic mixed layer depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al"", "" As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al"",

It is an update to the original Arctic Ocean Tidal Inverse Model (AOTIM5) model developed in 2004 ( Padman and Erofeeva, 2004 ). Arc5km2018 was created using the OSU Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS) package . The bathymetry grid is based on the original International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) bathymetry ( Jakobsson et al., 2000 ). Arc5km2018 was developed using the scheme described in Egbert and Erofeeva (2002) , and consists of grids of sea surface height and depth-integrated currents (""volume transports"") for each of 12 tidal constituents; 5 semidiurnal (M2, S2, K2, N2, 2N2), 4 diurnal (K1, O1, P1, Q1), and 3 non-linear (M4, MS4, MN4). Arc5km2018 assimilates coastal and benthic tide gauges, and TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason and European Space Agency (ESA) satellite radar altimetry, to improve the five largest-amplitude constituents, M2, S2, N2, K1 and O1.  Arc5km2018 includes the following updates relative to AOTIM5: (1) it uses an improved prior model with ocean open boundary forcing from an updated TOPEX/Poseidon global barotropic global tide solution (TPXO9.1); (2) it adds four tidal constituents, 2N2 and the three non-linear constituents; and (3) it assimilates much longer time series of altimetry, notably from the ESA satellites that sample to 81.5 degrees north.

The boat is made of glossy acrylic capped ABS and propelled by dual jet-pump engines. Lake depth was measured by means of a 50/200 kHz transducer. The depth uncertainty was estimated to be of the order of 20–30 cm by testing the set up in a swimming pool before the shipping and deployment to Greenland. However, the uncertainty on depth might be higher than the one obtained in the pool because of the roughness of the bottom of the supraglacial lake, which might be responsible for multiple echos. The boat was deployed 2-5 July 2010, on the west margin of the GrIS (Lake Olivia, 69 3603500 N, 49 2904000 W), with deployment time usually occurring when the sun was at zenith and measurements lasting for a few hours. As the boat average speed was 1 m/sec and the GPS data were recorded every second, we estimate a spatial resolution of 1m for the in-situ data. The spectral (450–1050 nm, with a 3 nm resolution) and depth data collected between two subsequent GPS acquisitions were averaged and assigned to the first of the two GPS locations. The total number of samples used in our analysis is 6000. Though the boat here used is much smaller than manned boats and casts a relatively small shadow, we acknowledge that this might still be a source of uncertainty. During the maneuvering of the boat, we paid attention in avoiding that the boat would not cast a shadow across the instrumental field-of-view while driving it. Another mitigating factor includes the use of the arm on the side of the boat in order to position the spectral sensor at a certain distance from the hull. The irradiance and radiance sensors were cross-calibrated in the laboratory following Mueller (2003). The diffuse irradiance leaving the outlet of an integrating sphere, illuminated by a calibrated xenon lamp, was measured by the irradiance sensor directed at the outlet. Radiance measurements were then taken of a Spectralon© target (99% reflectance) put in place of the irradiance sensor. These measurements were used to derive reflectance from irradiance and radiance intensity measurements and cross-calibrate the two sensors.

In addition, sensor-specific dynamic range (brightest and darkest possible measurements) and radiometric resolution (8-bit or 12-bit) were used to create the most realistic emulation possible.

Hicks under the supervision of Dr. T. McGovern. The project Centennial Scale Human Ecodynamics at Skútustaðir will contribute to the understanding of long-term economic and ecological practices in N. Iceland by examining the archaeological record of a district-center farm, Skútustaðir, first settled during Iceland's initial settlement period (871-950 CE) and occupied through to the present. During this farm's long history, inhabitants experienced economic consolidation, colonialism, changes in land tenure and land use in addition to fluctuations in their natural environment including climactic change and soil depletion. These factors interacted directly with subsistence practices (McGovern et al. 2007, McGovern et al. 2006). Long term sites such as Skútustaðir would have been the social and economic backbone of their regions. Their study is crucial to generating the long term picture of settlement history, ecological history and social history in this region though time. Theoretical foundations of this research include Historical Ecology in archaeology as laid out by Carole Crumley (1994) with its concern for historical context and emphasis on long term investigations of landscapes changing through time while dialectically influenced by human activity. The project's main method is zooarchaeology which is particularly relevant in Iceland as the vast majority of dietary subsistence and economic transactions were based on animal products. The proposed field research includes the excavation of additional zooarchaeological material (animal bones) as evidence of subsistence practices from the middle ages to complete the chronology of this long term site. The research proposed includes the analysis of dated samples of eggshell already excavated- evidence of a sustainable long term tradition of egg harvesting at Skútustaðir a tradition with social and ecological dimensions in the most diverse waterfowl habitat on earth (Lake Mývatn).

A survey with floatplane certified pilots residing in Alaska, asked pilots about the extent of continued flights to their 2015 destinations should these become invaded by elodea.  The dataset is a panel dataset such as used in recreation demand models and compiled from multiple data sources:  1)	survey with floatplane pilots that asked about flight patterns (destinations and frequency of flights) for a) the 2015 floatplane season, and b) a hypothetical scenario in which flight destinations are affected by an aquatic invasive plant creating flight safety hazards.  The resulting panel dataset therefore shows the pre-invasion actual flight information combined with information on post-invasion contingent behavior as stated by respondents (Englin and Cameron, 1996; Hynes and Greene, 2013). Each respondent’s individual destinations were grouped into eight destination regions encompassing large watersheds (HUCs) defined by the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) (USGS, 2017). A no-fly destination alternative was included to account for the difference between pre- and post-invasion flight activity across all destination alternatives. A binary choice variable indicated to which region the pilot flew. Summarizing, the panel for each respondent includes nine rows (pre-invasion) for 8 destination alternatives as reported for 2015 and one no-fly alternative (for pre-invasion), and nine rows (8 destination regions and 1 no-fly) for post-invasion. A weight variable is used to scale up flight frequencies to each destination region for the entire population of floatplane pilots residing in Alaska.  2)	The destination regions closely align with watershed boundaries of smaller scale game management units (GMU) for which data on hunting quality is available from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Hunting quality was assessed by calculating species-specific ratios of the reported number of animals killed to the reported number of hunters within a GMU. We calculate a kill per hunter ratios in order to capture both the recreation outcome and effort similar to catch per unit effort used in fisheries. It serves as an indirect measure for the abundance of target species (Skalski et al., 2005). If a GMU spanned multiple watershed boundaries we calculated the percent of the GMU area within each of the watersheds and used the percent to allocate the number of hunters and harvest among watersheds.  Consequently, if two pilots flew to the same watershed region but their individual destinations fall into different GMUs, hunting quality will vary between the two pilots.", It serves as an indirect measure for the abundance of target species (Skalski et al,

Changes in clay mineralogy across an inactive outwash fan (Black Fan) in the valley reflect weathering since the fan’s formation during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1550-1920). X-Ray Diffraction analysis of clay samples from the meltwater channels and the Kapp Starostin rocks that compose the fan reveal a strong 10 Å peak, unaffected by ethylene glycol solvation or heating to 375°C and 550 °C, indicative of illite. However, samples collected from vegetated debris flows between the meltwater channels reveal a diminished 10 Å phase and a slightly expandable peak at approximately 14 Å, unaffected by magnesium and glycerol saturation (d 060 of 1.54 Å), indicative of vermiculite. The inverse relationship between these peaks reflects the weathering of illite to vermiculite, suggesting an early period of Kapp Starostin Fm. deposition subsequently eroded by meltwater from Kongressbreen (glacier) during the LIA. Changes in lake sediment chemistry should reflect changing sources of sediment inflow as meltwater from an advancing ice activated the Black Fan. X-Ray Fluorescence analysis of the White and Black Fan, which are the only sources of sediment inflow to the lake, reveals that the Black Fan sediments have greater concentrations of K2O, Fe2O3,Zr, and Cr, while the White Fan is characterized by higher concentrations of MgO, CaO, Sr, and U. However, analysis of sediment cores from the central part of the lake reveals a chemical composition that resembles only that of the White Fan sediment, indicating almost no Black Fan input into Kongressvatnet. The most likely hypothesis to explain this absence is that Kongressbreen was a cold-based glacier and therefore did not produce fine glacial flour from scour of bedrock. Despite the dominant White Fan signature in the core sediments, ITRAX Scanning XRay Fluorescence analysis reveals significant variations in core chemistry with depth, which is likely due to changes in climate. Periodic, massive high calcium layers, lacking internal laminations characterize the upper 200 mm of the core, which correlates using MS to cores dated to the LIA (Guilizzoni et al., 2006). Preliminary SEM analysis reveals the presence of euhedral, sharp-edged rhombohedra and fibrous needles of calcite, high-Mg calcite, and dolomite, suggesting the precipitation of carbonate. The current supersaturation of Kongressvatnet waters below the chemocline with respect to calcite further supports this hypothesis. Alternatively, periods of extended ice cover during which the formation of lake ice concentrates the calcium in the underlying lake water, and may result in the formation of cryogenic calcite. Anomalous peaks in iron and sulfur characterize the lower core (300-400 mm), which MS correlations indicate corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period (Guilizzoni et al., 2006). An increase in organic terriginous inflow during this period likely spurs the activity of sulfur reducing bacteria, resulting in reducing conditions and the precipitation of iron sulfides. This analysis suggests that although provenance cannot be used in Kongressvatnet to constrain the timing of the Little Ice Age, changes in climate are intimately associated with fluctuations in lake chemistry and thelake’s biogeochemical cycles, providing the opportunity to interpret past climate change from lake sediment chemistry.","c("" Periodic, massive high calcium layers, lacking internal laminations characterize the upper 200 mm of the core, which correlates using MS to cores dated to the LIA (Guilizzoni et al"", "" Anomalous peaks in iron and sulfur characterize the lower core (300-400 mm), which MS correlations indicate corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period (Guilizzoni et al"")",

This research was conducted on Spitsbergen, the largest island of Svalbard, as part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The Norwegian High Arctic, containing Svalbard, is influenced by the northern extent of the Gulf Stream and the advection of warm air and moisture to the high latitudes. Its position creates highly variable conditions which directly affect the mass balance of glaciers on Svalbard. Work by Hagen et al. (2003) calculated the surface mass balance of Svalbard to be -4.5+/-1 km3 Yr/1. Understanding the factors influencing glacier mass balance and quantifying ablation rates provides ground-truthed data to gauge the Arctic’s reaction to changing climatic conditions and its influence in the global climate system. A compilation of mass balance measurements, local meteorological data, stream gauge, and suspended sediment concentrations were studied over a five week period during the summer 2006 melt season. High resolution data was collected in 30-minute intervals and manual readings were taken at eight glacier ablation centerline stakes on Linnèbreen. Comparisons were made directly to meteorological data, affording assessment of the correlations between the local and regional weather data and the dynamic behavior of this glacier. Summer precipitation was found to be the main agent of surface lowering on Linnèbreen. Days of high precipitation correlate directly with days of greater surface lowering and peak suspended sediment in the meltwater stream. High rates of lowering are interpreted to be the result of latent heat release caused by meltwater and precipitation percolating down into and refreezing below the glaciers surface. This triggered the removal of overlying ice, providing a glassy surface until such time that eolian debris and new sediment could accumulate and melt in differentially due to contrasts in albedo. Sediment flux to the meltwater stream is derived by erosion of sediment liberated by prior glacial activity. Supply is dominated by active layer thawing around the meltwater stream, resultant of rising temperatures and precipitation induced high discharge. The rise and fall of discharge, allowing temporary storage in ice-marginal channels and braidplains, display a diurnal SSC trend. Linnèelva operates in a dominantly supply limited mode due to the lack of active glacial erosion, with signs of complete sediment depletion over the meltseason. Sedimentation rates are likely to rise as the active layer deepens around the proglacial meltwater stream due to rising temperatures, and proposed increases in the Arctic’s precipitation budget allow for high discharge events. A net mass balance of -1.14m water equivalent was measured for Linnèbreen in 2006, producing a volumetric melt of 0.0028km3. 93.6% of Linnèbreen’s mass now lies entirely below the modern ELA at 458m. Extensive mass loss, associated with the ice margin retreat of ca. 1200m from its maximum extent during the LIA, could signal a significant change in thermal regime from its previous inferred warm based structure. The vast supraglacial and ice marginal meltwater network strongly supports the instrumental data and conclusion that Linnèbreen is composed almost entirely of cold based ice. The 4-6°C warming at the end of this century proposed by Alley et al (2006), based on the literature and IPCC (2007), is expected to have vast consequences on Svalbard. These temperatures are over two times higher then values estimated for the warmer early Holocene by Hald et al. 2004 and Overpeck et al. 1997. The average ELA on the archipelago was calculated at ca. 450m by Hagen et al. (2003) coinciding with the altitude containing the most ice mass. Further warming, changes in moisture advection, and a freshening of the Arctic Ocean are expected to cause a rise in the regional ELA. This will result in accelerated deglaciation of Svalbard, a situation unprecedented during the Holocene.","c("" Work by Hagen et al"", "" The 4-6°C warming at the end of this century proposed by Alley et al (2006), based on the literature and IPCC (2007), is expected to have vast consequences on Svalbard"", "" These temperatures are over two times higher then values estimated for the warmer early Holocene by Hald et al"", "" 2004 and Overpeck et al"", "" 450m by Hagen et al"")",

The goal of this initiative involved mooring the IB Oden to an ice floe in the inner pack ice in the high Arctic Ocean, and monitoring key oceanic-atmospheric parameters as the ice drifts. The cruise timeline (August through September) was chosen to highlight the transitional time period from the summer maximum in microbial biomass to declining stocks as autumn conditions result in lower nutrient and light levels, concomitant with the onset of freezing conditions. Biogenic aerosol production and fluxes are key research parameters in understanding the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and their impacts on the radiation budget of the Arctic Ocean. At present, there exists a paucity of data regarding how microbial community composition might change in the high Arctic Ocean, especially with respect to changes in the production of volatile aerosol precursor compounds as pelagic microbial communities replace sympagic communities. Specifically, this project focused on linking microbial community structure with the oceanic-atmosphere fluxes of volatile organic carbon compounds (VOCs) emitted from various oceanic and pack ice ecosystems.  The role of diminishing sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean will significantly impact biogenic aerosol production and fluxes via changes in microbial community structure and the release of VOCs. At present, however, the scarcity of in-situ oceanic VOC measurements available from the high Arctic Ocean prevents the development of robust models correlating phytoplankton biomass with VOCs and their impact on aerosol production. For instance, most current models utilize satellite chlorophyll a (Chla) imagery for estimating phytoplankton biomass (e.g. Gabric et al. 2014; Becagli et al. 2016). It is also well recognized that high concentrations of sea surface chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can significantly bias remotely-sensed Chla concentrations, especially when Chla levels are &amp;amp;lt;0.5 mg m-3 (Matsuoka et al. 2017). In addition to the bias in estimating in-situ phytoplankton biomass from satellite-derived Chla, the contribution made by oceanic VOC fluxes to the atmospheric aerosol optical depth (e.g. Gabric et al., 2002) is unknown. Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic mixed layer depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al., 2011). As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al. 2013). Hence, models that use satellites over relatively large areal expanses in the Arctic may be biased with regards to estimates of biomass, net primary production and as a result correlations to biogenic aerosol (Arrigo et al., 2011, Becagli et al., 2016). More importantly, however, total Chla biomass is not the only important variable affecting the production of oceanic biogenic VOCs and aerosols. The microbial community composition and physiology will not only affect the cell-specific production rate of precursor biogenic aerosol compounds, but also the secondary transformations of those compounds. Furthermore, determining VOCs or phytoplankton functional groups from space are both fraught with even more difficulty than Chla estimates alone. Consequently, at present, virtually no data exists regarding the suite of VOCs released to the high Arctic atmosphere as a function of the in-situ microbial community composition.  This dataset includes processed CTD data from 19 casts from August 2 to September 20, 2018. These data include temperature, salinity and density profiles, often up to 1000m, which provide information on water column structure and MLDs. Because most of these samples were collected in the same location, but over time, we begin to gain insight into changes in the water column, influenced by under-ice currents, ice coverage and wind intensities.","c("" Gabric et al"", "" 2014; Becagli et al"", ""5 mg m-3 (Matsuoka et al"", "" Gabric et al"", "" Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic mixed layer depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al"", "" As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al"",

The delta has an annual growth rate of 6.0x105 m3 a-1, determined from bathymetric profiling and aerial photos taken inbound and outbound of Ny Ålesund. Sedimentation in Kongsfjorden, where the subglacial derived meltwater stream discharges after flowing over the delta, were recorded, from sediment traps located at the given distances, as 7.5 ± 1.6 g cm-2 a-1 (69.4 mm a-1 vertical thickness) at 204m in fjord from the source, and 9.19 ± 4.4 g cm-2 a-1 (85.5 mm a-1) at 1193 m from the delta source. The higher value with distal location being attributed to the influx of sediment from a submarine, subglacial meltwater discharge plume from Kronebreen glacier ~2.5 km north of the newly formed delta (Trusel et al., 2006). Sedimentary processes, observed in CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles, strongly resemble those characteristics of Alaskan glaciers in the temperate environment, including settling sediment layers, interflows, and turbidity flows. These structures are also recorded in both gravity and box cores by sedimentary core logging, magnetic susceptibility, core x-rays, and mineralogical and sediment size distribution histogram differences. Erosive efficiency and transportation of sediment of Svalbard’s polythermal glaciers, in the subpolar environment, are intermediately between Alaskan warm-based, temperate environment, and Antarctic cold-based, polar environment, glaciers.

To predict the effects of the TAW (transformed Atlantic water) intrusion on the ice margin of tidewater glaciers, a detailed understanding of fjord circulation is important. While the general fjord circulation of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, is well- understood, water masses closest to the ice margin and directly responsible for sub-marine glacial melt are more difficult to study. To characterize the water masses and interpret fjord circulation at the calving-fronts of glaciers Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, Svalbard, oceanographic fieldwork was conducted along five primary transects, with the view to account for tidal influences as well. CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) devices with attached OBS (relative turbidity) sensors were used to collect data that range from 200 m to 1.7 km from the ice face, between 22 Jul and 6 Aug 2011. Current velocities were also estimated using drogues constructed while in Svalbard. The data show significantly variability in the water column stratification between just days. In addition to the tidal cycle, winds and other factors also appear to play a major role in glacial discharge streams and circulation. A comparison with data collected in the same region in Jul 2005 (by Trusel et al. 2010) show the 2011 Intermediate Water (IW) at depth to be warmer than the local water (LC) that was observed at comparable depths in 2005. These two layers lie above the TAW and may be warmer as a result of convection with increased TAW waters. Increased intrusion of Atlantic-origin waters after 2005 are likely to have warmed the waters in the inner fjord of Kongsfjorden, indicating that the ice margin of tidewater glaciers in Kongsfjorden are susceptible to heat fluxes from North Atlantic water intrusions.", A comparison with data collected in the same region in Jul 2005 (by Trusel et al,

In the Arctic, wind is the dominant driver of sea ice and ocean motion. The momentum flux from the atmosphere into the ocean (a.k.a. ocean surface stress) generally depends the wind speed, the surface roughness, and sea ice conditions. Here, we provide Arctic-wide (49&#730;-90&#730;N) daily fields of ocean surface stress based on a simulation with the Pan-arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) for the period 1979-2012. The simulation is forced by atmospheric reanalysis fields and constrained by assimilating satellite-observed sea ice edge position. Our analysis yielded two main results: (i) Over the 34-year period annual mean basin-wide ocean surface stress is increasing, which we link to the significant sea ice thickness decrease and related ice strength loss over the same period. (ii) Momentum flux into the ocean is greatest at an optimal ice concentration of 80-90%. This is because the overall surface roughness increases with increasing ice coverage as sea ice adds roughness but only to a point, the optimal ice concentration, where frictional losses due to high ice compactness reduce the momentum transfer. As summer Arctic sea ice coverage has been shrinking over the past years, our data show decreasing ocean surfaces stress for the summer months (July to September).

We used a Bruker Skyscan 1172 desktop micro computed tomography system and the associated proprietary reconstruction and postprocessing software. MicroCT data began as raw tiff X-ray images taken at a number of rotation steps (0.7 deg apart) between 0 and 180 deg. These were reconstructed into bitmap (bmp) slices of the sample. A volume of interest was selected and the data within it binarized by the use of thresholds to distinguish ice from air and brine. Binarized images of the slices of the VOI are also saved as bmp files.  We identified a set of metrics that can be gleaned from X-ray micro-computed tomography and are useful for interpreting the microstructure of sea ice (Lieb-Lappen et al., 2017). We have used these to quantify some differences in brine channel topology with depth, and some differences between granular and frazil ice.  Finally, we tested the Notz wire harp by cutting a hole in the ice cover in late February 2015 (Feb 14-19, 2015) and freezing the harp into it. Based on the principle that pure solid ice is a good insulator whereas interstitial saltwater brine is a good conductor, the device developed by Notz, Worster and Wettlaufer (Notz et al., 2005; Notz and Worster, 2008) records temperature and resistivity at different depths as ice grows around it. Salinity of the interstitial brine is then inferred from the liquidus relationship (Cox and Weeks, 1986) and can be combined with the measured solid mass fraction to give the bulk salinity profile of the growing sea ice. This was a preliminary test for later use of the harp on another project.  Notz, D., Wettlaufer, J. & Worster, M. (2005).

This effort is a follow-up to an EAGER award that allowed collection of initial core material and a seismic dataset in Simpson Lagoon near the Colville River delta in August 2010. Initial results suggest that these sediment cores contain a valuable history of system response to climate change on the adjacent continent (e.g., river drainage basins) and terrestrial-marine linkages. All cores will be analyzed for stratigraphy (X-radiography), bulk organic and mineral content, granulometry, and geochronology (239,240Pu/137Cs). Detailed analysis for paleoclimate proxies will be carried out: the age-depth relationship for the deeper part of these cores will be determined using radiocarbon. Climate indicators that will be applied are organic biomarkers (lignin-phenols, cutins, plant pigments, and ä13C) and mineral tracers (major and trace element chemistry, stable isotopes, clay mineralogy, heavy mineral assemblages, granulometry, event-layer stratigraphy). The central hypothesis is that lagoonal settings within the Beaufort Sea contain high quality sediment records because they receive sediment input from larger rivers that drain the Brooks Range, that, if exploited, will dramatically improve our knowledge of high Arctic paleoclimate over the last two millenia. The PIs hypothesize three distinct sources: 1) rivers that drain the Brooks Range and the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), 2) storms that erode shoreline permafrosted ACP deposits and overwash barrier islands, and 3) marine primary production by phytoplankton, ice algae, and benthos. After an initial micro-scale examination of recent event layer (annual and storm deposits) mineral and POC succession, necessary to interpret paleoclimate-induced fluctuations in composition, they will examine the downcore record of temporal variations in layers, contrasting sites to decouple spatial changes in sources. Since the three source end-members have distinct mineral/POC composition, they believe that temporal variations will provide proxy information about climate changes that influence their flux magnitude including 1) landfast ice extent, 2) river sediment supply from the glaciated uplands, 3) permafrost thawing, 4) summer-fall storminess, and 5) coastal primary productivity.

Samples were collected in late 2012 on cruise ARK-XXII/3 on the RV Polarstern. Snow has been suggested to be an effective scavenger of PFAS in the atmosphere 41 and an evidence for a primary source of PFAA to the Arctic via atmospheric oxidation of volatile precursors. More PFASs (C11 PFCA, FOSA, and EtFOSAA) were detected in melt pond water and snow samples when compared to those of water samples collected from the Arctic shelf and Ocean. Samples were collected from mostly first year ice, integrating PFAS deposition from up to one year. In the present investigation, the snow samples showed detectable concentrations of PFCAs (C6-C12), PFSAs (C8 and C10), MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA and FOSA (Figure 3). Concentrations were similar or greater to previously reported for the Devon ice cap (Young et al., 2007). Relatively high total PFAS concentration was observed in Station 5 - PS80/323 (1.60 ng/L; Station 1: 0.298 ng/L and Station 8: 0.368 ng/L). For all PFASs, there were stronger correlations between concentration and degree longitude, rather than degree latitude. Regressions versus longitude were significant (p&amp;lt;0.10) for PFHxA and PFNA, and at p&amp;lt; 0.20 for PFOA and PFOS. PFAS concentrations increased as samples were taken further east.

Lakes were extracted from the IfSAR DSM using a slope derivative and manual correction (Jones et al., 2017). The vertical uncertainty for correctly detecting lake-based drainage gradients with the IfSAR DSM was defined by comparing surface elevation differences of several overlapping DSM tile edges. This comparison showed standard deviations of elevation between overlapping IfSAR tiles ranging from 0.0 to 0.6 meters (m). Thus, we chose a minimum height difference of 0.6 m to represent a detectable elevation gradient adjacent to a lake as being most likely to contribute to a rapid drainage event. This value is also in agreement with field verified estimates of the relative vertical accuracy (~0.5 m) of the DSM dataset  around Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) (Manley et al., 2005) and the stated vertical RMSE (~1.0 m) of the DSM data (Intermap, 2010). Development of the potential lake drainage dataset involved several processing steps. First, lakes were classified as potential future drainage candidates if the difference between the elevation of the lake surface and the lowest elevation within a 100 m buffer of the lake shoreline exceeded our chosen threshold of 0.6 m. Next, we selected lakes with a minimum size of 10 ha to match the historic lake drainage dataset. We further filtered the dataset by selecting lakes estimated to have low hydrological connectivity based on relations between lake contributing area as determined for specific surficial geology types and presented in Jones et al. (2017). This was added to the future projection workflow to isolate the lake population that likely responds to changes in surface area driven largely by geomorphic change as opposed to differences in surface hydrology. Lakes within a basin with low to no hydrologic connectivity that had an elevation change gradient between the lake surface and surrounding landscape are considered likely locations to assess for future drainage potential. Further, the greater the elevation difference, the greater the drainage potential. This dataset provided a first-order estimate of lakes classified as being prone to future drainage. We further refined our assessment of potential drainage lakes by identifying the location of the point with the lowest elevation within the 100 m buffer of the lake shoreline and manually interpreted lakes to have a high drainage potential based on the location of the likely drainage point to known lake drainage pathways using circa 2002 orthophotography or more recent high resolution satellite imagery available for the Western Coastal Arctic Plain (WACP). Lakes classified as having a high drainage potential typically had the likely drainage location associated with one or more of the following: (1) an adjacent lake, (2) the cutbank of a river, (3) the ocean, (4) were located in an area with dense ice-wedge networks, (5) appeared to coincide with a potentially headward eroding stream, or (6) were associated with thermokarst lake shoreline processes in the moderate to high ground ice content terrain. We also added information on potential lake drainage pathways to the high potential drainage dataset by manually interpreting the landform associated with the likely drainage site to draw comparisons with the historic lake drainage dataset.","c("" Lakes were extracted from the IfSAR DSM using a slope derivative and manual correction (Jones et al"", ""5 m) of the DSM dataset  around Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) (Manley et al"", "" We further filtered the dataset by selecting lakes estimated to have low hydrological connectivity based on relations between lake contributing area as determined for specific surficial geology types and presented in Jones et al"")",

The firn model has 200 layers. each composed of snow, ice and water compartments. Layers are managed in a Lagrangian framework with a splitting/merging strategy that keeps the resolution higher close to the surface. During snowfall, fresh snow is added as a new 4 cm w.e. thick layer with a density of 315 kg m-3 to the top of the model. During melt, mass is taken from snow and ice compartments of the top layer and transferred to the water compartment. Downward flow follows Darcy's law as described by Langen et al.

Localized values of sea ice surface snow accumulation rates are created using on-sea ice and coastal based in-situ measurements of snow depth. These values are interpolated to a grid using estimates of net precipitation, derived from TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) satellite water vapor and winds retrievals [Groves and Francis, 2002] as a background field. A model is then used to accumulate snow at each grid point based upon whether ice is present and its surface is not melting.

Monthly gridded model output is representative of mid-month snow depths. Net precipitation, ice surface freeze/melt products and model output are all at 25 km grid spacing, using the northern hemispheric Equal-Area Scalable Earth projection [see: http://nsidc.org/data/ease/].

Data were collected around the Toolik Field Station (68.63°N, 149.60°W) in May-August of 2009-2012. Additional samples were collected from Feniak Lake (68.27°N, 158.34°W) in and Kelly River (67.94°N, 162.39°W). To test the impact of thermokarst on the hydrologic export of carbon and nitrogen, we measured carbon (DOC, DIC, and dissolved CH4), nitrogen, and major ions in outflows of thermokarst features and reference waters. For thermokarst features with surface flow, water samples were collected above, throughout and below the impacted area. We also sampled nearby reference water tracks and soil water unimpacted by thermokarst formation to serve as controls. Samples were analyzed for DIC and DOC using a Shimadzu 5000 TOC analyzer. Total dissolved nitrogen was measured with an Antek 7050 nitric oxide chemiluminescent detector plumbed in line with the TOC analyzer. A Dionex Ion Chromatograph was used to analyze samples for anions and cations (Cl-, NO3-, NO2-, SO42-, Ca+, Na+, NH4+, Mg2+, and K+). 18O was analyzed on a Picarro L1102-i isotopic analyzer. Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O was extracted from solution and analyzed on a Varian 3300 gas chromatograph. To characterize the temporal progression of thermokarst from formation to stabilization and recovery we classified features on a five point activity scale defined as follows: 0-No apparent present or past thermokarst impact&#8232; 1-Stabilized and revegetated, vegetated stream bed (clear outflow) 2-Limited thermo-degradation, cobble stream bed (clear outflow) 3-Moderate thermo-degradation with (somewhat turbid outflow) 4-Active thermo-degradation, (turbid outflow)&#8232; 5-Very active thermo-degradation (totally turbid outflow) To test the impact of thermokarst on gaseous carbon flux, we measured the gaseous release of CO2 and CH4 from control and impacted sites using a Li-COR Li-8100 automatic soil respiration monitoring system and static chambers. Because thermokarst disturbance creates a jumble of vegetation and mineral soil we classified sites by ground cover type. Divisions are defined as follows: Undisturbed tundra-More than 5 m outside any visible disturbance with no apparent past or present thermokarst activity Margins-Within 5 m of visible disturbance but have not experienced subsidence Drapes-Subsided but vegetation is still attached to surrounding tundra Tundra rafts-Subsided and detached from surrounding tundra Exposed-Surfaces where vegetation has been removed exposing bare mineral soil We measured soil temperature and soil moisture in situ at each site with a soil temperature probe and a ThetaProbe ML2x soil moisture sensor calibrated to local soils. We also sampled soil gas to characterize the distribution of CO2, CH4 and N2O production on the landscape. We measured soil gases with a 40 cm long 0.3 cm diameter hollow stainless steel tube with intake ports drilled in the final 5 cm. After inserting the sipper to a depth of 15 cm, we drew up and flushed 5 ml of soil gas through the tube and then collect the sample with an airtight syringe attached to the end of the sipper tube.

Gas samples were analyzed on a Varian 3300 gas chromatograph for CO2, CH4, and N2O. We also measured rates of nitrogen transformation and size of nitrogen pools at multiple thermo-erosion gullies. Extractable pools of inorganic N were determined by extraction in 2 M KCl. NH4 concentration was determined using the phenol-hypochlorite method, and NO3- via cadmium reduction on a Bran+Luebbe Autoanalyzer 3. Soil pH was determined on slurries in deionized water that had equilibrated with the atmosphere for 30 min. Total C and N were measured following acidification of samples to remove inorganic C on a Costech 4010 elemental analyzer. Net rates of N mineralization and nitrification were estimated as net change in inorganic N or NO3- pools, respectively, following aerobic incubation for 7 days at 20 °C. Potential rate of nitrifi- cation was measured in aerobic slurries supplemented with 0.5 mM NH4? and 1 mM PO43- that were sub-sampled four times in 24 h. CaCl2 was added to each sub-sample as a flocculant, and solids were separated using a centrifuge. NO3-concentration of the supernatant was analyzed as previously described. Potential rate of nitrification was calculated as the change in NO3- concentration over the incubation time. We assayed potential denitrification enzyme activity using the acetylene block method. Media containing 722 mg NO3--N/L, 100 mg dextrose/L, and 10 mg chloramphenicol/L was purged of O2 using N2 and added to soils in gas-tight jars equipped with a stopcock, followed by purging with N2 for 2 min. Acetylene was added to the sample headspace (10 % v/v) to prevent the reduction of N2O to N2, and samples were vented to bring pressure to ambient. Following vigorous shaking, headspace gas was sampled and stored in evacuated containers. Headspace was sampled again after 4 h of incubation at 20 °C. Headspace N2O concentration was analyzed on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph via electron-capture detection. Bunsen coefficients were applied to determine the mass of N2O dissolved in the slurry, and total N2O produced by each sample was used to calculate production of N2O over the incubation period.

These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems.  In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for a half million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice.  Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge.  Based on benthic sampling in 2010‒2012, a model of eider foraging energetics, and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997‒2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding.  In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited, or too far from landfast ice, to provide regular hunting access.  In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable but often within a consistent geographic range.  Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters’ needs.  These results can inform spatial planning of industrial activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in less developed locations.  Our study provides an approach for mapping “subsistence conservation areas” throughout the Arctic, and an example for such efforts elsewhere.  “Healthy wildlife populations, productive habitat for those populations, and access to subsistence hunting are all measures of our people’s health.”  ‒ Edward Itta, former Mayor of the North Slope Borough, Alaska (Glenn et al. 2011)  The RAR files contain geodatabases.","”  ‒ Edward Itta, former Mayor of the North Slope Borough, Alaska (Glenn et al",

Using polynomial chaos (PC) methods, we propagate uncertainties in physicochemical properties and emissions for the PAHs benzo[a]pyrene, pyrene and phenanthrene to simulated spatially resolved concentration uncertainties. We find that the leading contributors to parametric uncertainty in simulated concentrations are the black carbon-air partition coefficient and oxidation rate constant for benzo[a]pyrene, and the oxidation rate constants for phenanthrene and pyrene. NH geometric average concentrations are more sensitive to uncertainty in the atmospheric lifetime than to emissions rate. We use the PC expansions and measurement data to constrain parameter uncertainty distributions to observations. This narrows a priori parameter uncertainty distributions for phenanthrene and pyrene, and leads to higher values for OH oxidation rate constants and lower values for European PHE emission rates.

Niskin bottles were deployed either just above the CTD (40 m) or by hand on a line over the side (0 m and 10 m samples) and tripped by messenger. Water was sampled immediately upon recovery of the Niskins. For chlorophyll a analysis, 100 ml of seawater was filtered onto GF-F glass fiber filters in triplicate for each bottle. Two hundred ml subsamples for determination of microzooplankton biomass and abundance were preserved with 5 percent final concentration acid Lugol solution for inverted microscopy. For flow cytometry samples, 3 ml aliquots were pipetted into 4 ml cryovials and preserved with 0.2 percent final concentration of freshly made paraformaldehyde. The samples were gently mixed and let sit in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes before quick-freezing and storage -80 degrees Celsius until flow cytometric analysis was performed.

The goal of this initiative involved mooring the Icebreaker (IB) Oden to an ice floe in the inner pack ice in the high Arctic Ocean, and monitoring key oceanic-atmospheric parameters as the ice drifts. The cruise timeline (August through September) was chosen to highlight the transitional time period from the summer maximum in microbial biomass to declining stocks as autumn conditions result in lower nutrient and light levels, concomitant with the onset of freezing conditions. Biogenic aerosol production and fluxes are key research parameters in understanding the formation of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and their impacts on the radiation budget of the Arctic Ocean. At present, there exists a paucity of data regarding how microbial community composition might change in the high Arctic Ocean, especially with respect to changes in the production of volatile aerosol precursor compounds as pelagic microbial communities replace sympagic communities. Specifically, this project focused on linking microbial community structure with the oceanic-atmosphere fluxes of Volatile Organic Carbon compounds (VOCs) emitted from various oceanic and pack ice ecosystems.  The role of diminishing sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean will significantly impact biogenic aerosol production and fluxes via changes in microbial community structure and the release of VOCs. At present, however, the scarcity of in-situ oceanic VOC measurements available from the high Arctic Ocean prevents the development of robust models correlating phytoplankton biomass with VOCs and their impact on aerosol production. For instance, most current models utilize satellite Chlorophyll a (Chla) imagery for estimating phytoplankton biomass (e.g. Gabric et al. 2014; Becagli et al. 2016). It is also well recognized that high concentrations of sea surface chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can significantly bias remotely-sensed Chla concentrations, especially when Chla levels are &amp;amp;lt;0.5 milograms per meter cubed (mg m-3) (Matsuoka et al. 2017). In addition to the bias in estimating in-situ phytoplankton biomass from satellite-derived Chla, the contribution made by oceanic VOC fluxes to the atmospheric aerosol optical depth (e.g. Gabric et al., 2002) is unknown. Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al., 2011). As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al. 2013). Hence, models that use satellites over relatively large areal expanses in the Arctic may be biased with regards to estimates of biomass, net primary production and as a result correlations to biogenic aerosol (Arrigo et al., 2011, Becagli et al., 2016). More importantly, however, total Chla biomass is not the only important variable affecting the production of oceanic biogenic VOCs and aerosols. The microbial community composition and physiology will not only affect the cell-specific production rate of precursor biogenic aerosol compounds, but also the secondary transformations of those compounds. Furthermore, determining VOCs or phytoplankton functional groups from space are both fraught with even more difficulty than Chla estimates alone. Consequently, at present, virtually no data exists regarding the suite of VOCs released to the high Arctic atmosphere as a function of the in-situ microbial community composition.  The included dataset contains algal pigment concentrations found in samples collected during this expedition. Not only do these data provide estimates of phytoplankton community biomass, they also begin to shed light on the phytoplankton community composition, as taxonomic groups can be identified (or at least estimated) by the presence of a few indicating pigments. Because most of these samples were collected in the same location, but over time, we begin to gain insight into the shift of the phytoplankton community composition from the summer maximal biomass (August) to the declining community as autumn conditions result in lower nutrient and light levels and increased ice cover (September). Over the course of this expedition, CTD casts were made to collect samples from 5-200 meters , to adequately sample the photic zone. Casts were made at the marginal ice zone, as well as on an almost-daily basis at the mooring location in the high Arctic Ocean.","c("" Gabric et al"", "" 2014; Becagli et al"", ""5 milograms per meter cubed (mg m-3) (Matsuoka et al"", "" Gabric et al"", "" Moreover, incorrect estimates of the oceanic Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) using climatological datasets and/or subsurface Chla maximum can further compound the errors associated with attempting to correlate phytoplankton integrated water column production with estimates of biomass derived using satellite Chla algorithms (Arrigo et al"", "" As a result, questions remain regarding the reliability of using Chla estimates as a surrogate to estimate the organic carbon enrichment in submicron marine aerosols (Rinaldi et al"",

This evolution, entitled the Community Observing Network for Adaptation and Security (CONAS) requires a bridging period of approximately one year. The team will build off of the key elements of the BSSN data collection mechanisms but expand these to include more variables of interest and place them in a sociocultural context so that arctic communities and governments will be able to anticipate, plan and respond to these changes through the development of Adaptive Capacity Indices (ACIs). A transition year will allow the research team and participating Bering Sea communities to plan for full implementation of CONAS. CONAS will examine environmental change and response within a framework of social-ecological system (SES) science. In an SES context, the ability of a community to respond successfully to change is referred to as its adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity reflects both the sensitivity of community members to their environment and their ability to institute changes that make them less vulnerable to a given perturbation (Ensor and Berger 2009, Wilkinson 2012).

While the general fjord circulation of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, is well understood, water masses closest to the ice margin {and directly responsible for submarine glacial melt {are more difficult to study. To characterize the water masses and interpret fjord circulation at the calving-fronts of glaciers Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, Svalbard, oceanographic fieldwork was conducted along five primary transects, with the view to account for tidal influences as well.

This effort is a follow-up to an EAGER award that allowed collection of initial core material and a seismic dataset in Simpson Lagoon near the Colville River delta in August 2010. Initial results suggest that these sediment cores contain a valuable history of system response to climate change on the adjacent continent (e.g., river drainage basins) and terrestrial-marine linkages. All cores will be analyzed for stratigraphy (X-radiography), bulk organic and mineral content, granulometry, and geochronology (239,240Pu/137Cs). Detailed analysis for paleoclimate proxies will be carried out: the age-depth relationship for the deeper part of these cores will be determined using radiocarbon. Climate indicators that will be applied are organic biomarkers (lignin-phenols, cutins, plant pigments, and ä13C) and mineral tracers (major and trace element chemistry, stable isotopes, clay mineralogy, heavy mineral assemblages, granulometry, event-layer stratigraphy). The central hypothesis is that lagoonal settings within the Beaufort Sea contain high quality sediment records because they receive sediment input from larger rivers that drain the Brooks Range, that, if exploited, will dramatically improve our knowledge of high Arctic paleoclimate over the last two millenia. The PIs hypothesize three distinct sources: 1) rivers that drain the Brooks Range and the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), 2) storms that erode shoreline permafrosted ACP deposits and overwash barrier islands, and 3) marine primary production by phytoplankton, ice algae, and benthos. After an initial micro-scale examination of recent event layer (annual and storm deposits) mineral and POC succession, necessary to interpret paleoclimate-induced fluctuations in composition, they will examine the downcore record of temporal variations in layers, contrasting sites to decouple spatial changes in sources. Since the three source end-members have distinct mineral/POC composition, they believe that temporal variations will provide proxy information about climate changes that influence their flux magnitude including 1) landfast ice extent, 2) river sediment supply from the glaciated uplands, 3) permafrost thawing, 4) summer-fall storminess, and 5) coastal primary productivity. Noting the rapid changes that have occurred in the Arctic during the latter half of the 20th century, the federal interagency Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) program has cited the need to determine to what extent recent and ongoing climate changes in the Arctic can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing. A successful project will contribute to answering that question."," Noting the rapid changes that have occurred in the Arctic during the latter half of the 20th century, the federal interagency Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) program has cited the need to determine to what extent recent and ongoing climate changes in the Arctic can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing",

The 5.75 km² lake is set in a 35.3 km² catchment and fed by the glacier, Linnébreen, (1.7 km²) along with several small cirque glaciers. Currently, Linnébreen covers roughly 5% of the watershed in the valley of Linnédalen. The vast majority of sediment is moved into the lake during the early summer snow melt; however, particularly warm summers increase sediment transport from the landscape into the lake as the glacier continues to generate melt-water (Werner et al., 2008; McKay, 2005). Previous sedimentological studies (Pratt, 2006; Leon, 2006; Yellen, 2006; Snyder et al., 2000) have focused on sediment cores recovered from basins proximal to the inflow delta of Linnéelva in 10 to 15 meters water depth. These studies have shown that the sediments are annually laminated (varved) in these locations. Here we present results of varve thickness measurements from two sediment cores from mooring G (B1-08, B2-08) taken in the deepest basin (35 m water depth), located in the distal northerly portion of the lake. High resolution thin section analyses down both cores find that varve thickness trends are in agreement. Increasing annual varve thickness measurements show a positive correlation (r² = 0.32, 0.18 P < 0.01) with yearly historic summer (July-August) temperature measurements from a meteorological station at Isfjord Radio Station (1947-2003 AD). External forcings (solar, volcanic, etc) appear to play a key role in environmental change, especially prior (< 1850 AD) to increased anthropogenic aerosols and CO2. Despite the relatively short length, Linnévatnet’s varve record adds to the few high-resolution climate data in a region critical for understand earth’s climate system.","c("" The vast majority of sediment is moved into the lake during the early summer snow melt; however, particularly warm summers increase sediment transport from the landscape into the lake as the glacier continues to generate melt-water (Werner et al"", "" Previous sedimentological studies (Pratt, 2006; Leon, 2006; Yellen, 2006; Snyder et al"")",

Transect 5 was established to provide better options for permafrost coring on the west side of the road, since deep flooding and gravel deposits from previous flood events prevented coring on Transect 4. Transect 5 also provides an approximate local analog of the conditions that existed prior to road construction. Data were collected on all three transects during 1-10 August and 16-23 September 2015.

Results with a large-scale coupled ice-ocean model [Zhang and Steele, 2007] suggest the appropriate model background mixing for the Arctic Ocean is an order of magnitude lower than for ice-free oceans. Background mixing in the deep ocean is related to internal wave energy, which in ice-covered seas has been observed to be lower than in ice-free oceans, and to change with time and bathymetric conditions [Levine et al., 1985 and 1987; Halle and Pinkel, 2003; Pinkel, 2005]. Present thinking is that internal wave energies and background mixing are reduced in ice-covered seas by, among other things, dissipation of internal wave energy in the surface boundary layer immediately below the ice. Consequently, if the ice cover is reduced due to global warming, we may see a climate feedback that has not been considered before. If the ice cover is reduced, we may see increased internal wave energy, mixing, and heat flux in the deep ocean because less internal wave energy would be lost in the under-ice boundary layer. This would tend to result in increased heat flux to the ice, a positive climate feedback that would melt more ice. The effect could arguably be greatest near the continental slopes and submarine ridges, which are the likely areas of greatest internal wave increase and the paths of warm Atlantic water through the Arctic Basin. The sensitivity ocean circulation and energy balance to background mixing and the criticality of ocean heat and freshwater fluxes, suggest that as the Arctic Ocean changes, we should be tracking background mixing the way we track temperature and salinity. Direct measurements of mixing are difficult, but decades of research show that deep background mixing is a consequence of dissipation of internal wave energy. The exact nature of this relationship is an ongoing question, but it makes it possible to infer mixing from relatively simple observations of internal wave energy [e.g., Gregg, 1989; D'Asaro and Morison, 1992; Kunze et al., 2006]. In our new NSF-OPP project, Sensitivity of Arctic Ocean Change to Background Mixing (ARC- 0909408), we will be gathering together and analyzing existing Arctic Ocean data for internal waves and mixing using new methods, which in many cases have not been applied to the Arctic environment. As part of our renewed North Pole Environmental Observatory Grant (ARC-0856330) we are now dropping eXpendable Current Profilers (XCP) as a standard part of our NPEO airborne hydrographic surveys. The velocity shear measured by these probes, along with the CTD data, gives us a simple estimate of background internal wave energy from which background mixing can be inferred. We are collaborating with Ilker Fer of the University of Bergen in deploying and analyzing both his and our NPEO XCPs. We analyze the XCP data under our ""Mixing"" grant, and with other data, we will use them to track changes in internal wave energy and related mixing. We will also be performing a simple studies of the energetics of internal waves that combine existing ideas about the forcing of internal waves with new ice model results [Heil and Hibler, 2002; Hibler et al., 2006]. As part of the Mixing Project we are offering here data suitable for use by anyone doing Arctic Ocean model predictions (e.g., the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project, AOMIP). We are starting by assembling and analyzing XCP data from field projects associated with the North Pole Environmental Observatory beginning in 2007, plus older data from the first SCICEX cruise in 1993. CTD profile profile data pertient to the analysis are either included or directly referenced in other archives. New data will be added as it becomes available. References: - D'Asaro, Eric A. and J.H.
